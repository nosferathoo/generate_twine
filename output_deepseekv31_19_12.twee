:: StoryStart
The sky is a perpetual, bruised purple, heavy with the memory of fire. Decades have passed since the Ashfall Cataclysm, when the world tore itself open and choked on its own burning heart. A fine, gray dust settles on everything—your worn coat, the rusted husk of a long-dead vehicle, the skeletal remains of a forest that will never be green again. You are a Wanderer, a survivor defined by the road itself. Your origins are a story told in the set of your jaw and the caution in your eyes.

Tucked inside your gear is a fragile prize: a scorched piece of synth-parchment, a map fragment. Whispers in the few settlements brave enough to trade speak of Haven-0, a mythical pre-Cataclysm facility that could cleanse the sky. This fragment, stolen from raiders during a blinding ash storm, is said to be the first of four keys to finding it. The weight of it is immense. It is either a map to salvation or a warrant for your death, depending on who learns you carry it.

Ahead, the wastes stretch out, a monochrome expanse of rolling ash dunes and jagged rock formations. The wind carries a low, constant moan, a sound that is both a warning and a companion. Your immediate goal is clear: survive the next few miles, find shelter before the next toxic squall hits, and decide where to begin the impossible search for the remaining fragments. The road forks here, not just in the dirt under your boots, but in the choices you must make.
[[Press on toward the distant glow of a settlement's lights->AshDunesSettlementGlow]]
[[Follow a set of fresh tracks leading into a rocky canyon->AshDunesCanyonTracks]]
[[Head for a skeletal communication tower on the horizon->AshDunesCommTower]]
:: AshDunesSettlementGlow
The glow resolves into flickering electric lanterns strung along a high wall of scrap metal and packed earth. This is the Outpost of Last Hope, a name that sounds more desperate the closer you get. The main gate is a massive door of welded vehicle parts, currently open just a crack. Two guards in patched enviro-suits watch your approach, their rifles held with a weary readiness.
[[Approach the guards and request entry->OutpostGate]]
[[Skirt the walls, looking for another way in or a sign of the Nomads->OutpostWalls]]

:: AshDunesCanyonTracks
The tracks are deep, made by the wide, treaded tires of a large vehicle—a land-train, most likely, used by the militaristic Steel Legion. They lead into the shadows of the canyon. The air grows still and cold. Around a bend, you find the source: a Legion scout vehicle, its engine silent. It's parked near the entrance to a small cave. There are no signs of the crew, but the vehicle's hatch is open.
[[Investigate the abandoned scout vehicle->CanyonScoutVehicle]]
[[Enter the cave to look for the missing crew->CanyonCaveEntrance]]

:: AshDunesCommTower
The tower is a relic, a rusting finger pointing accusingly at the dead sky. A rickety ladder ascends into the superstructure. At its base, the ruins of a control building have been partially reclaimed by the dunes. A faint, rhythmic beeping sound emanates from within the rubble, a stubborn electronic heartbeat.
[[Climb the tower to get a vantage point->CommTowerTop]]
[[Search the ruined control building for the source of the beeping->CommTowerRuin]]

:: OutpostGate
One guard steps forward, her visor raised to reveal a tired face. "State your business, Wanderer. We're not taking on extra mouths to feed unless you've got something to trade." She eyes your gear, her gaze lingering on the bulk of your pack where the map fragment is hidden.
[[Offer to trade scavenged parts->OutpostGate-Trade]]
[[Mention you're looking for information on old-world facilities->OutpostGate-Info]]
[[Ask about the Dustborn Nomads->OutpostGate-Nomads]]

:: OutpostGate-Trade
You lay out some usable circuitry and a clean water filter. The guard nods, satisfied. "Alright. You can come in. Keep to the main market, don't cause trouble." She steps aside, allowing you entry into the bustling, crowded interior of the outpost.
[[Enter the outpost->OutpostMarket]]

:: OutpostGate-Info
The guard's eyes narrow. "Old-world facilities are a good way to get killed. The Union boys in their bunkers might know, or the Legion hunts for that stuff. But asking those questions here marks you as either very brave or very stupid." She gestures for you to enter, but her watchfulness has intensified.
[[Enter the outpost cautiously->OutpostMarket]]

:: OutpostGate-Nomads
"A Nomad skiff passed by this morning, heading west toward the Salt Flats. They don't often stop here," the guard says. "If you're looking to catch them, you're behind schedule." She seems curious about your interest but ultimately waves you inside.
[[Enter the outpost->OutpostMarket]]

:: OutpostWalls
Moving silently along the perimeter, you find a section where the wall is lower, shielded by a pile of debris. A small, grimy face peeks out from a gap in the scrap. It's a child, who quickly puts a finger to their lips and gestures for you to follow. They duck into a hidden tunnel.
[[Follow the child into the tunnel->OutpostHiddenTunnel]]

:: CanyonScoutVehicle
The vehicle is unlocked and empty. The console is powered down, but a datapad lies on the pilot's seat. Its screen displays a partial log entry: "...investigating anomalous energy signature. Possible Union activity. Proceeding on foot. Captain Hale will want..." The rest is cut off.
[[Take the datapad->CanyonScoutVehicle-HasDatapad]]
[[Leave the datapad and continue into the cave->CanyonCaveEntrance]]

:: CanyonScoutVehicle-HasDatapad
You slip the Legion datapad into your pack. It could be useful, or it could be a death sentence if found on you. The cave mouth ahead seems darker, more foreboding.
[[Enter the cave->CanyonCaveEntrance-HasDatapad]]
:: CanyonCaveEntrance
The cave is damp and cool, a stark contrast to the dry waste outside. Faint, echoing voices can be heard from deeper within. As your eyes adjust, you see two Legion soldiers standing over a third person who is kneeling on the ground—a woman with sharp features and garments made of layered, ash-resistant cloth.
[[Step forward and intervene->CaveConfrontation]]
[[Stay hidden and observe->CaveObservation]]

:: CanyonCaveEntrance-HasDatapad
The cave is damp and cool. You hear voices. Two Legion soldiers are interrogating a sharp-featured woman in ash-resistant cloth. Having the datapad makes you acutely aware of your connection to this scene.
[[Step forward and intervene->CaveConfrontation-HasDatapad]]
[[Stay hidden and observe->CaveObservation-HasDatapad]]
:: CommTowerTop
The view from the top is vast and desolate. To the west, you see the glittering salt flats. To the east, the jagged line of the Rust-Ridge Mountains. A flicker of movement catches your eye: a convoy of armored vehicles—Steel Legion land-trains—moving fast along a dust-choked road, heading north. Then, a voice from below: "Enjoying the view, scavenger?"
[[Look down to see who spoke->CommTowerTop-MetLyra]]

:: CommTowerTop-MetLyra
A woman stands at the base of the ladder. She wears a hooded coat and carries a staff adorned with scavenged tech. "That Legion convoy isn't on a sightseeing tour," she says. "They're hunting. You might want to come down before they decide this tower is a strategic asset." Her eyes are keen, intelligent.
[[Climb down to talk to her->CommTowerBase-MetLyra]]

:: CommTowerRuin
Digging through the rubble, you find a sealed storage locker. The beeping is coming from inside. It's a Union-made distress beacon, still active. Forcing the locker open, you find not just the beacon, but also a small, hardened data-chip labeled "GeoCore Survey 7."
[[Take the data-chip->CommTowerRuin-HasDataChip]]
[[Leave the chip and only take the beacon->CommTowerRuin-HasBeacon]]

:: CommTowerRuin-HasDataChip
The data-chip feels heavy with potential. You pocket it and the beacon. As you turn to leave, a shadow falls over the doorway. A woman with a tech-adorned staff stands there. "That's a dangerous piece of history you've found," Lyra says.
[[Face the newcomer->CommTowerRuin-MetLyra]]

:: CommTowerRuin-HasBeacon
You take the beacon, leaving the data-chip behind. A shadow falls over the doorway. A woman with a tech-adorned staff stands there. "A beacon? Someone's been waiting a long time for a rescue that's never coming," she notes.
[[Face the newcomer->CommTowerRuin-MetLyra-Beacon]]

:: CommTowerRuin-MetLyra
"I'm Lyra. Some call me Ashwitch. I can read the storms in the data-streams," she says, gesturing to your pocket. "That chip you found... it's part of a larger puzzle. The same puzzle you're working on, if the rumors about a map-bearing Wanderer are true."
[[Ask how she knows about the map->TowerRuinTalk1]]
[[Show her the map fragment->TowerRuinTalk2]]
:: CommTowerRuin-MetLyra-Beacon
"I'm Lyra," the woman says. "An Ashwitch. I read the storms. That beacon is old Union tech. A relic." She seems less interested than if you had found the chip. "The waste is full of ghosts. But you seek something more solid, don't you?"
[[Ask what she means->TowerRuinTalk1-Beacon]]

:: OutpostMarket
The market is a cacophony of barter and survival. Vendors hawk filtered water, reclaimed ammunition, and questionable protein paste. You notice a group of Dustborn Nomads in their distinctive woven robes at a stall, arguing quietly with a stern-looking man who has the bearing of a Legion officer.
[[Approach the Nomads->MarketNomads]]
[[Eavesdrop on the argument between the Nomads and the Legionary->MarketArgument]]
[[Head to a quieter part of the market to examine your map->MarketAlley]]

:: OutpostHiddenTunnel
The tunnel is tight and dark, emerging into a hidden alcove within the outpost walls. The child is gone, but a young woman sits there, sharpening a blade. She looks up. "The guards don't like strangers sneaking in. But the Legion pays them to be watchful, and I don't like the Legion. I'm Moth. You look like you're going somewhere important."
[[Introduce yourself->HiddenTunnel-MetMoth]]

:: HiddenTunnel-MetMoth
"Moth? Like the insect?" you ask. She smiles. "They find their way in the dark. I know paths the Legion and even the Nomads miss. If you're heading into the deep wastes, you might need a guide." She gestures to the map fragment you've unconsciously touched. "And I know a thing or two about old paper."
[[Accept her offer of guidance->HiddenTunnel-WithMoth]]
[[Decline politely, preferring to travel alone->HiddenTunnel-Alone]]

:: HiddenTunnel-WithMoth
"A guide could be useful," you admit. Moth's smile widens. "Good. We should leave before that Legion officer finishes his business. There's a back way out." She leads you through a series of hidden passages, away from the market's noise.
[[Follow Moth out of the outpost->WastelandTrail-WithMoth]]

:: HiddenTunnel-Alone
"I travel better alone," you say. Moth nods, her smile fading. "I understand. The road is jealous. Good luck, Wanderer." She melts back into the shadows of the alcove. You are left to find your own way out of the outpost.
[[Return to the market->OutpostMarket]]

:: CaveConfrontation
"You alright?" you call out, stepping into the light. The soldiers spin around, raising their rifles. The kneeling woman seizes the moment, kicking one soldier's legs out from under him. In the confusion, she rolls toward you. "A little help would be appreciated!" she yells.
[[Help her fight the soldiers->CaveFight]]
[[Create a distraction to help her escape->CaveDistraction]]

:: CaveConfrontation-HasDatapad
You step forward. "Let her go." The soldiers turn. One recognizes the datapad in your hand. "Thief!" he snarls. The woman uses their distraction to disarm one soldier. "Don't just stand there!" she shouts. The situation has escalated instantly.
[[Engage the soldiers->CaveFight-HasDatapad]]
[[Throw the datapad aside and flee with the woman->CaveEscape-HasDatapad]]
:: CaveObservation
You remain hidden. The woman is defiant. "The Legion has no authority here, Captain Hale," she spits at the taller soldier. "The energy signature is neutralized. You've found nothing." Hale backhands her. "The Technic Union will learn to cooperate, Lyra. One way or another." They bind her hands and lead her deeper into the cave.
[[Follow them stealthily->CaveTunnel]]
[[Retreat and exit the cave->CanyonExit]]

:: CaveObservation-HasDatapad
You watch as Captain Hale strikes the woman, Lyra. They bind her and move deeper into the cave. You have their datapad. If you're caught, it will mean death. But leaving her feels wrong.
[[Follow them carefully->CaveTunnel-HasDatapad]]
[[Leave the cave quickly->CanyonExit-HasDatapad]]
:: CaveFight
You charge the standing soldier, tackling him before he can fire. The woman, Lyra, expertly subdues the other. In moments, both Legionaries are disarmed and unconscious. Lyra gets to her feet, brushing off her clothes. "Timely intervention. I'm Lyra. And you've just made a powerful enemy. We should go."
[[Leave the cave with Lyra->CanyonExit-WithLyra]]

:: CaveFight-HasDatapad
The fight is brief and brutal. With the element of surprise, you and Lyra quickly overpower the soldiers. Lyra picks up the datapad you dropped. "Hale's personal log? This is valuable. Come on, we need to move before more show up." She leads the way out.
[[Exit the cave with Lyra->CanyonExit-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: CaveDistraction
You knock a loose rock from the wall, creating a loud clatter. The soldiers turn toward the noise. Lyra instantly breaks free, sliding into the shadows behind them. She signals for you to follow her down a side passage. The soldiers, confused, give chase but soon lose your trail in the dark tunnels.
[[Follow Lyra to safety->CaveEscape]]

:: CaveEscape-HasDatapad
You hurl the datapad against the far wall. It shatters. "What did you do?" one soldier cries out, distracted. Lyra escapes her grip and pulls you down a narrow tunnel. "That was... dramatic," she says as you run. "I'm Lyra. Now, run!"
[[Escape with Lyra->CaveEscapeRoute-WithLyra]]
:: CaveTunnel
You follow the echoes of the Legion squad. The tunnel opens into a larger cavern illuminated by portable lights. There's a sealed door set into the rock, marked with the symbol of the Technic Union. Captain Hale is trying to force it open. Lyra is tied to a stalagmite, watching him with cold hatred.
[[Attempt a rescue now->CavernRescue]]
[[Wait for a better opportunity->CavernWait]]

:: CaveTunnel-HasDatapad
You trail the Legion squad to a Union-marked door in a large cavern. Hale is trying to breach it. Lyra is captive. Your possession of the datapad makes you feel complicit.
[[Stage a diversion to free Lyra->CavernRescue-HasDatapad]]
[[Use the datapad's knowledge to bluff your way in->CavernBluff]]
:: CanyonExit
You emerge from the cave alone, the sun a dull coin in the ash-gray sky. The Legion scout vehicle still sits silently. The encounter leaves you with a name: Lyra. And a faction: the Steel Legion, led by Captain Hale, is actively hunting for old-world tech.
[[Continue your journey north toward the mountains->RustRidgeFoothills]]
[[Head west to the salt flats, following the Nomad lead->SaltFlatsEdge]]

:: CanyonExit-WithLyra
Outside the cave, Lyra studies you. "You saved me from a unpleasant conversation with Hale. I owe you. I'm a technomancer, exiled from the Union. I know how to read the data on that map fragment of yours. If you're heading to Haven-0, you'll need my skills to decipher the rest."
[[Travel with Lyra->WastelandTrail-WithLyra]]
[[Part ways, trusting your own instincts->WastelandTrail]]
:: CanyonExit-WithLyra-HasDatapad
In the open air, Lyra hands you back the datapad. "Hale's logs mention a 'GeoCore Vault' in the Rust-Ridge mountains. That could be where another fragment is. I can help you find it, but we need to move fast. The Legion will be hunting us both now."
[[Accept Lyra's help and head for the mountains->RustRidgeFoothills-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
[[Go your separate ways, taking the datapad's info with you->RustRidgeFoothills-HasDatapad]]
:: CaveEscapeRoute-WithLyra
You and Lyra exit the cave system through a hidden fissure, far from the canyon entrance. "That was close," she says, catching her breath. "I'm Lyra. It seems we're both on the Legion's list now. I can help you understand your map. The old symbols are a kind of code."
[[Join forces with Lyra->WastelandTrail-WithLyra]]
[[Thank her and continue alone->WastelandTrail]]
:: CavernRescue
You create a noise at the cavern's entrance. As one soldier investigates, you rush the other, freeing Lyra. Hale turns, drawing his sidearm. "Run!" Lyra shouts, and you both dash back into the tunnels, pursued by shouts and gunfire.
[[Escape the cavern->CaveEscapeRoute-WithLyra]]

:: CavernRescue-HasDatapad
You lure a soldier away, then ambush him. Freeing Lyra, you face Hale. He aims his pistol. "You have my property," he growls, meaning the datapad. Lyra throws a smoke pellet, and you vanish into the tunnels amid the confusion.
[[Escape with Lyra->CaveEscapeRoute-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]

:: CavernBluff
You step into the light, holding up the datapad. "Captain Hale! I've decoded the access sequence from your logs." Hale lowers his weapon, suspicious. "Is that so?" Lyra looks at you, stunned. You approach the door, praying your bluff works.
[[Attempt to open the Union door->UnionDoorBluff]]

:: UnionDoorBluff
[[Retreat back into the tunnels with Lyra->CaveEscapeRoute-WithLyra]]
:: WastelandTrail
The open wastes are silent save for the wind. You are alone with your thoughts and your goal. The path ahead is uncertain, but the map fragment is a constant weight, a promise or a curse.
[[Travel toward the Rust-Ridge mountains->RustRidgeFoothills]]
[[Head for the shimmering Salt Flats->SaltFlatsEdge]]

:: WastelandTrail-WithLyra
[[Travel toward the Rust-Ridge mountains->RustRidgeFoothills-WithLyra]]
[[Head for the shimmering Salt Flats->SaltFlatsEdge-WithLyra]]
:: WastelandTrail-WithMoth
Moth moves with a light, surefooted grace, pointing out safe paths through unstable ground and hidden water sources. "The Nomads say the second fragment is in a place called the Sunken Library," she says. "But it's in Ashen Choir territory. They don't like visitors."
[[Ask Moth about the Dustborn->TrailTalkMoth1]]
[[Ask about the Sunken Library->TrailTalkMoth2]]

:: RustRidgeFoothills
The mountains rise like the bones of the earth, sharp and forbidding. The air is thinner here. Below, you can see the massive, tracked vehicles of the Steel Legion carving a road through the valley. Their destination seems to be a specific peak.
[[Ascend the mountain, trying to stay ahead of the Legion->MountainAscent]]
[[Find a way to observe the Legion's activity from a hidden vantage->MountainVantage]]

:: RustRidgeFoothills-WithLyra-HasDatapad
"The datapad confirms it," Lyra says, looking at the Legion convoy. "They're heading for the GeoCore Vault. We need to get there first. There's a hidden ascent on the northern face, but it's dangerous."
[[Take the dangerous northern route->MountainAscent-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
[[Let the Legion go first and look for an opportunity to slip in behind them->MountainVantage-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]

:: RustRidgeFoothills-HasDatapad
Alone, you watch the Legion convoy. The datapad's information points to the GeoCore Vault. Getting there before them or around them will be a challenge.
[[Attempt a swift, direct climb->MountainAscent-HasDatapad]]
[[Take a slower, stealthier path->MountainVantage-HasDatapad]]
:: SaltFlatsEdge
The salt flats are a blinding white expanse under the gloomy sky, a surreal landscape of crystalline structures and utter emptiness. In the distance, you see the familiar silhouette of a Nomad sand-skiff, its sails filled with the sluggish wind. It seems to be stopped, perhaps broken down.
[[Approach the Nomad skiff->NomadSkiff]]
[[Circle around the skiff, looking for signs of the Ashen Choir->SaltFlatsCircle]]

:: MountainAscent
The climb is grueling. Loose shale slides under your boots. Near the summit, you find a carved entrance into the mountain, sealed by a massive metal door bearing the GeoCore logo. It's intact, but there are recent scuffs around the lock—signs of attempted entry.
[[Try to find another way in->MountainSummitSearch]]
[[Attempt to force the lock->MountainDoorForce]]

:: MountainAscent-WithLyra-HasDatapad
The northern route is treacherous, a narrow ledge over a sheer drop. But it brings you to a hidden ventilation shaft leading into the mountain. "This is it," Lyra says. "An old maintenance access. The Legion won't know about this."
[[Enter through the ventilation shaft->GeoCoreVentEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]

:: MountainAscent-HasDatapad
You push hard and reach the GeoCore door first. The Legion's attempts to open it are evident. Using information from the datapad, you might have a better chance.
[[Use the datapad to try and bypass the lock->MountainDoorDatapad]]
[[Abandon the door and search for another entrance->MountainSummitSearch-HasDatapad]]
:: MountainVantage
You find a good hiding spot with a view of the Legion's camp below. They've set up a perimeter around the main entrance. Captain Hale is there, barking orders. You also see a smaller, secondary entrance—a personnel door—lightly guarded on the far side of the camp.
[[Wait for nightfall to attempt a stealthy approach to the personnel door->MountainNightApproach]]
[[Create a diversion to draw the guards away from the personnel door->MountainDiversion]]

:: MountainVantage-WithLyra-HasDatapad
From your vantage, you and Lyra plan. "The personnel door is our best bet," she whispers. "But we need the guards gone. I can cause a power fluctuation in their comms equipment—a small distraction. It might be enough."
[[Use Lyra's distraction to sneak to the door->MountainDistractionEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
[[Wait for a natural shift in the guard patrol->MountainPatientEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]

:: MountainVantage-HasDatapad
You observe the Legion camp. The personnel door is the weak point. You'll have to get past the guards alone.
[[Attempt a silent approach at night->MountainNightApproach-HasDatapad]]
[[Use a rock slide as a diversion->MountainDiversion-HasDatapad]]
:: NomadSkiff
As you get closer, you see the skiff is indeed disabled, its main rudder broken. A young Nomad is trying to repair it, looking frustrated. It's Moth, the courier from the outpost. She looks up, surprised to see you. "Wanderer! My luck might be turning. Can you give me a hand with this?"
[[Help Moth repair the skiff->SkiffRepair-MetMoth]]
[[Ask her why she's out here alone->SkiffQuestion]]

:: SkiffRepair-MetMoth
You help Moth secure the broken rudder with a spare part from your pack. She beams at you. "Thanks! This skiff is my life. Climb on, I'll give you a ride to the Library. It's faster than walking, and we can avoid the worst of the Choir's lookouts."
[[Join Moth on the skiff->SaltFlatsSkiff-WithMoth]]
:: SkiffQuestion
"I'm a courier," Moth says, still working on the rudder. "I carry messages between the Nomad clans and... sometimes others. It's risky. The Choir especially doesn't like outsiders. I heard you were looking for old-world things. The Library has many. And guards."
[[Offer to help with the skiff in exchange for information->SkiffRepair-MetMoth]]
[[Leave her to her work and continue on foot->SaltFlatsEdge-Alone]]

:: SaltFlatsCircle
Circling wide, you see a group of figures in gray, ash-caked robes approaching the skiff from the opposite direction—Ashen Choir zealots. They move with a silent, purposeful gait. Moth hasn't seen them yet.
[[Rush to warn Moth->SkiffWarning]]
[[Use the opportunity to sneak past both groups toward the Library->SaltFlatsSneak]]

:: GeoCoreVentEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad
The shaft leads into a dark, dusty maintenance tunnel within the GeoCore Vault. The air is stale. Lyra uses a small light on her staff to illuminate the way. The tunnel opens onto a gantry overlooking a vast, underground cavern. Below, ancient machinery hums. In the center of the cavern, on a pedestal, glows a crystal data-shard—a map fragment. The main vault door remains closed.
[[Descend to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
[[Search the gantry for a control room->GeoCoreControlRoom-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: MountainDoorDatapad
[[Enter the GeoCore Vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-HasDatapad-Datapad]]
:: MountainNightApproach
Under cover of darkness, you slip past the drowsy guards and reach the personnel door. It's locked, but a manual override panel is exposed. It requires a keycode.
[[Try to short-circuit the override panel->PersonnelDoorForce]]
[[Retreat and look for another way->MountainSummitSearch]]

:: MountainDistractionEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad
Lyra focuses, and a Legion comms unit suddenly screeches with feedback. In the confusion, you both dash to the personnel door. Lyra quickly patches her datapad into the lock and it slides open. You slip inside just as the guards regain their composure.
[[Enter the vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]

:: GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra-HasDatapad
You approach the glowing crystal shard on its pedestal. A holographic figure flickers to life—Dr. Oren Vale. The fragment pulses with potential. The main vault door remains closed for now.
[[Take the second map fragment->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
[[Listen to the full message->ValeRecording-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: GeoCoreConfrontation-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
Hale levels his pistol at you. "The fragments, Wanderer. And the technomancer. You've cost me enough time." His soldiers fan out, surrounding you and Lyra. The situation is desperate.
[[Stand your ground and refuse->ConfrontationRefuse]]
[[Try to negotiate with Hale->ConfrontationNegotiate]]
[[Throw the fragments to the ground and make a break for it->ConfrontationFlight]]
:: GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You and Lyra sprint back up the gantry to the maintenance tunnel. Legion fire ricochets around you. You scramble into the shaft just as the door closes behind you, sealing the Legion inside for a precious few moments. You have the fragment, but Hale has seen you, and he will not stop.
[[Escape the mountain->RidgeDescent-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]

:: SaltFlatsSkiff-WithMoth
The skiff glides silently over the salt, driven by the weak breeze. Moth points ahead. "The Sunken Library. It's not really sunken, it's just built low to the ground." A large, dome-like structure of stone and metal appears on the horizon. Ashen Choir sentries patrol its perimeter.
[[Approach the Library openly under a flag of parley->LibraryParley-WithMoth]]
[[Look for a hidden way in, avoiding the sentries->LibraryInfiltrate-WithMoth]]

:: LibraryParley-WithMoth
You and Moth approach with hands raised. A Choir Sentinel steps forward, his face hidden by a mask. "The texts are not for outsiders. Your presence defiles the sacred ash." Moth speaks up. "I have a message from the Eastern Clan! We seek only knowledge."
[[Try to persuade the Sentinel->LibraryPersuade]]
[[Moth's message causes a distraction, allowing you to slip inside->LibraryDistractionEntry]]

:: LibraryInfiltrate-WithMoth
Moth leads you to a collapsed section of the outer wall, hidden by a salt formation. You crawl through a narrow gap into a dark, dusty corridor within the Library. The air smells of old paper and incense.
[[Search for the fragment in the archives->LibraryArchives-WithMoth]]
[[Head toward the central chamber->LibraryCentral-WithMoth]]

:: LibraryArchives-WithMoth
The archives are vast, shelves stretching into darkness. Finding the fragment here could take days. Suddenly, a shadow detaches from the shelves. It's an old man, hunched and muttering to himself. He holds a glowing data-cube. "Vale said to protect it," he whispers. "Until the worthy one came."
[[Take the data-cube from the old man->LibraryFragmentTaken-WithMoth-MetOren]]
[[Talk to the old man->LibraryTalkOren]]

:: LibraryFragmentTaken-WithMoth-MetOren
You take the data-cube. The old man whimpers. This is the third fragment. You now travel with Moth and have met Dr. Vale.
[[Ask Vale to explain the nature of the Vault of Lament->ValeExplanation-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
:: RidgeDescent-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
[[Set a course for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You and Lyra stand at the edge of the nightmare landscape. The Forbidden Zone churns with violent energy storms. Lyra checks her scanner. "The storm activity is off the charts. Going in there is suicide without the right protection or a clear plan." The two map fragments in your pack hum insistently.
[[Press on despite the danger->ZoneStormEntry-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
[[Search for a safe path or shelter->ZoneShelterSearch-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: ZoneStormEntry-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You enter the storm. The world dissolves into howling wind and lashing energy. Lyra's tech fizzles. Visibility is zero. You are both thrown to the ground.
[[Be consumed by the maelstrom->Ending-DeathByStorm]]
:: Ending-DeathByStorm
The storm consumes you. Your body is scoured away by the ash, your map fragments lost to the wastes. Haven-0 remains a legend.
:: ZoneShelterSearch-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You find a half-buried entrance to a pre-Cataclysm subway tunnel. It offers shelter from the storm. Inside, it's quiet. A single light burns at the far end. As you approach, you see an old man tending a small heater. It's Dr. Oren Vale, alive and in hiding.
[[Approach Vale cautiously->SubwayValeMeeting-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]

:: SubwayValeMeeting-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
Vale looks up, not surprised. "I knew you would come. The fragments call to each other." He gestures to the fourth and final fragment, sitting on a crate beside him. "But before you take it, you must understand. Haven-0's purifier requires a catalyst—a massive energy source. Activating it will destroy the facility, and likely anyone inside."
[[Take the final fragment and commit to the pilgrimage->ValeJoins-WithLyra-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
[[Question Vale about alternatives->ValeDiscussion]]
:: Haven0Approach-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
You, Lyra, and Dr. Vale stand on a high ridge, looking down into the secluded valley where Haven-0 lies. The arcology is a marvel of preserved pre-Cataclysm engineering. Below, the factions have converged at the main entrance. Lyra checks her gear. "They're all here. A direct approach is a death sentence." Dr. Vale looks pale but resolute. "The final choice cannot be made by them. It must be ours."
[[Attempt to reason with the assembled factions->Haven0Parley-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]
[[Use the ridge to find a hidden path down to the facility->Haven0Infiltrate-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]
[[Charge down the slope through the chaos, trusting to speed->Haven0Assault-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]
:: Haven0Parley
You step forward, holding up the complete map. "This belongs to everyone! Haven-0 can save us all!" Captain Hale laughs. "Salvation requires order, not democracy!" A Choir priest shrieks, "It is blasphemy!" A Union scientist calmly states, "It requires study." Negotiations fail instantly, and the factions turn on each other—and you.
[[The battle begins->Haven0Battle]]

:: Haven0Core-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
The core chamber is vast, a cathedral of technology humming with dormant power. You and Lyra stand before the central control terminal, a complex array of screens and interfaces. The completed map in your hand projects the final activation sequence. Dr. Vale is not present. The warning about the facility's self-destruction echoes in your memory. Lyra meets your gaze, her expression serious. "The choice is yours."
[[Activate the purifier->Ending-Restoration]]
[[Modify the sequence to ensure your own survival and control->Ending-Dominion]]
[[Destroy the purifier, ensuring no faction can abuse it->Ending-Nomad]]
[[Sabotage the core, embracing the ash as divine->Ending-Ashen]]
[[Transfer control to the Technic Union->Ending-Technocratic]]
:: Ending-Restoration
You, Lyra, and Dr. Vale input the final commands. The machine hums to life, a glorious, rising tone. Light floods the chamber. You feel a tremendous heat building. The last thing you see is a brilliant beam of energy shooting into the sky through the arcology's apex. You die, but outside, the ash clouds part. For the first time in generations, clean, blue sky is visible. The world has a future. Your sacrifice is remembered as the dawn of a new age.

:: Ending-Dominion
"Find a way to save ourselves!" you command Vale. He recalibrates the system, diverting power to shields. The purifier activates, but at a reduced rate. The sky begins to clear slowly. You survive, and you control Haven-0. You use its technology to impose a harsh but stable order on the wastes, becoming the new, unchallenged power. Peace is achieved, but it is a peace of force and fear.

:: Ending-Nomad
"Destroy it," you tell Vale. "No one faction should have this power." He overloads the core. Haven-0 erupts in a cataclysmic explosion, scouring the valley clean. The factions are decimated. The hope of a quick fix is gone, but so is the threat of absolute control. The Nomads and other small groups are free to rebuild slowly, on their own terms. The world remains hard, but it is free.

:: Ending-Ashen
You smash the main console with your weapon. "The ash is our destiny," you say, agreeing with the Choir. Vale looks on in horror as the system fails critically, sealing Haven-0 forever. You walk out to join the chanting zealots. The world remains shrouded, and you embrace its bleak beauty, believing it to be the true, purifying will of the earth.

:: Ending-Technocratic
You allow a Union science team, which had infiltrated the facility, to take control. They optimize the purifier, clearing the skies efficiently and without drama. They then use their technological supremacy to guide the world's recovery with cold, logical precision. Human suffering is reduced, but individuality and freedom are sacrificed for the guaranteed survival of the species. It is a future of knowledge, without warmth.

:: CanyonExit-HasDatapad
You emerge from the cave alone, the Legion datapad a heavy secret in your pack. The scout vehicle stands as a silent monument to the confrontation you avoided. The names Lyra and Captain Hale echo in your mind. The Legion is hunting, and you now possess a piece of their intelligence.
[[Continue north toward the Rust-Ridge mountains->RustRidgeFoothills-HasDatapad]]
[[Head west to the salt flats->SaltFlatsEdge]]
:: CaveEscape
[[Thank her and continue alone->WastelandTrail]]
:: CaveEscapeRoute-WithLyra-HasDatapad
You run through the dark, the sound of pursuit fading behind you. Emerging into a narrow gully, you both stop to catch your breath. Lyra looks at you. "Shattering the datapad was a bold move. Now Hale has nothing, and we have a head start. I can help you decipher your map. The old codes are my specialty."
[[Accept her partnership->WastelandTrail-WithLyra]]
[[Continue alone->WastelandTrail]]
:: CavernWait
You hold your position, watching. Captain Hale finally bypasses the Union door with a breaching charge. The explosion echoes through the cavern. He and his soldiers drag Lyra inside the facility, leaving one guard outside. The door begins to close automatically behind them.
[[Attack the lone guard before the door seals->CavernGuardAttack]]
[[Retreat now that the cavern is clearing->CanyonExit]]

:: CommTowerBase-MetLyra
You climb down to meet the woman. Up close, her tech-adorned staff hums faintly. "I'm Lyra," she says. "The Ashwitch. I saw you from a ridge. You move with a purpose I don't often see. And that Legion convoy is heading for a GeoCore site. Your map fragment might be leading you to the same place."
[[Ask her what she wants->TowerBaseTalk1]]
[[Show her the map fragment->TowerBaseTalk2]]
:: ConfrontationFlight
[[Escape the vault->RidgeDescent-WithLyra-MetOren]]
:: ConfrontationNegotiate
"Captain Hale," you say, holding up the fragments. "We don't have to be enemies. We all want to save this world. We can work together." Hale scoffs. "Cooperation is a luxury we cannot afford. My order is my salvation." He signals his soldiers to advance. Your attempt at peace has failed.
[[Prepare to fight->ConfrontationRefuse]]
[[Attempt to flee->ConfrontationFlight]]

:: ConfrontationRefuse
"You'll have to take them," you growl, readying your weapon. Lyra stands beside you, her staff crackling with energy. "A poor choice," Hale says, and opens fire. The cavern erupts into a violent firefight, your position surrounded.
[[Fight to the death->Ending-LegionExecution]]
[[Make a desperate break for the tunnel->ConfrontationFlight]]

:: Ending-LegionExecution
The Legion soldiers are too many, too well-armed. You and Lyra are overwhelmed. Captain Hale takes the map fragments from your lifeless hands. "A necessary loss for a greater gain," he says coldly. Haven-0 falls under Legion control, and the world is remade by force.

:: GeoCoreControlRoom-WithLyra-HasDatapad
The gantry leads to a small control room overlooking the cavern. Dust-covered consoles display schematics of the vault. Lyra interfaces her datapad. "I can trigger a lockdown from here," she whispers. "It would seal the main door, trapping the Legion outside when they break in. But it might also seal us in."
[[Initiate the lockdown->ControlRoomLockdown]]
[[Leave the controls and descend to the cavern->GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: ControlRoomLockdown
You give the order. Lyra inputs the command. A deep thud echoes through the mountain as the main vault door slams shut and locks. The Legion's progress is halted. You have bought time, but you are now locked inside the vault with its secrets.
[[Descend to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra-HasDatapad-LockedIn]]
:: GeoCoreVaultEntrance-HasDatapad
You step into a stark, metal corridor. The air is cool. Ahead, a blue glow emanates from the main cavern.
[[Proceed toward the glow->GeoCoreCavern-HasDatapad]]
:: GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithLyra-HasDatapad
You enter the vault with Lyra. The hum of ancient machinery is deafening. A gantry overlooks a massive cavern where a crystal shard glows on a pedestal. Lyra points. "There it is. But we're not alone." She gestures to movement on the far side—Legion scouts have entered through another route.
[[Rush for the fragment->GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
[[Find a defensive position->GeoCoreGantryDefense-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: LibraryCentral-WithMoth
The central chamber is a dome filled with strange, glowing fungi that provide a dim light. In the center, a stone altar holds a data-cube identical to the one described in rumors. A lone Ashen Choir acolyte kneels before it, chanting softly. She has not noticed you yet.
[[Attempt to sneak past the acolyte and take the cube->LibraryCentralSteal]]
[[Confront the acolyte directly->LibraryCentralConfront]]

:: LibraryDistractionEntry
As Moth argues with the Sentinel, drawing all eyes, you slip behind a salt pillar and through an open archway into the Library. You find yourself in a quiet antechamber. The sounds of the confrontation outside are faint. You are inside, but alone for now.
[[Search for the archives->LibraryArchives]]
[[Head toward the central chamber->LibraryCentral]]

:: LibraryEscapeVale-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You grab the confused Dr. Vale and push him toward the charging Sentries. "Stop! The Oracle!" one of them shouts, hesitating to harm the old man. This moment of confusion is all you and Moth need to dash past them and into the corridors.
[[Flee the Library->LibraryEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: LibraryFight-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You and Moth stand back-to-back as the Sentries attack. Moth is agile, ducking and weaving, while you hold the line. It is a fierce struggle in the close quarters of the archives, but you manage to fight your way toward an exit.
[[Escape into the salt flats->SaltFlatsEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: LibraryPersuade
The Sentinel stands firm, his zeal a wall against your words. "The ash is divine will. Your hope is a defiance we cannot allow." He raises his weapon, and the other sentries close rank. Parley has failed.
[[Retreat and try to find another way in->SaltFlatsEdge-WithMoth]]
:: LibraryTalkOren
[[Take the cube with his blessing->LibraryFragmentTaken-WithMoth-MetOren-Talked]]
:: MarketAlley
You duck into a quiet alley between two makeshift shacks. Pulling out the map fragment, you study its burned edges and strange symbols. It feels ancient. A shadow falls over you. A gruff voice says, "That's a dangerous thing to be looking at in the open, friend."
[[Turn to face the speaker->MarketAlleyStranger]]
[[Hide the map and leave quickly->OutpostMarket]]

:: MarketArgument
You listen from a distance. The Legion officer is demanding information about "Union activity near the Rust-Ridge." The Nomads are refusing, stating their neutrality. The argument is tense, and it's clear the Legion is pressuring the Nomads for intelligence.
[[Intervene on the Nomads' behalf->MarketArgumentIntervene]]
[[Use the distraction to slip away unnoticed->MarketAlley]]

:: MarketNomads
You approach the Nomads. They look at you with cautious curiosity. One speaks. "You are the Wanderer. We have heard. You seek the old places. Our paths may cross in the salt flats. But beware the Choir—they guard the old knowledge fiercely."
[[Ask about the Sunken Library->MarketNomadsLibrary]]
[[Offer to trade for information->MarketNomadsTrade]]

:: MountainDiversion
You start a small rockslide above the Legion camp. The noise draws the guards' attention away from the personnel door. In the confusion, you make your move, sprinting across the open ground toward the secondary entrance.
[[Reach the personnel door->PersonnelDoorApproach]]

:: MountainDiversion-HasDatapad
You dislodge a cascade of rocks, creating a loud rumble. The Legion soldiers look up, concerned. Seizing the moment, you dash from your hiding spot and reach the personnel door unseen.
[[Attempt to open the door->PersonnelDoorForce-HasDatapad]]
:: MountainDoorForce
You try to pry the door open with a crowbar, but it's sealed tight. The noise echoes, and you hear shouts from the Legion camp below. You've alerted them to your presence. Time is now short.
[[Retreat and hide->MountainVantage]]
[[Make a stand at the door->MountainDoorStand]]

:: MountainNightApproach-HasDatapad
[[Enter the vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-HasDatapad]]
:: MountainPatientEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad
You wait for hours until the guard patrol shifts, leaving the personnel door unobserved for a brief moment. You and Lyra dash across the open ground and reach the door. Lyra quickly wires her datapad into the lock, and it opens.
[[Enter the vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]

:: MountainSummitSearch
You circle the summit, looking for another entrance. You find a fissure in the rock leading downward, but it's narrow and unstable. It might connect to the vault's interior, or it might lead to a dead end.
[[Risk entering the fissure->MountainFissureEntry]]
[[Return to the main door->MountainDoorForce]]

:: MountainSummitSearch-HasDatapad
Searching the summit, you find a ventilation shaft covered by a rusty grate. The datapad's schematics confirm it leads into the vault's maintenance levels. It's a tight, dangerous drop, but it's a way in.
[[Enter the ventilation shaft->GeoCoreVentEntry-HasDatapad]]
:: PersonnelDoorForce
You try to short-circuit the override panel. Sparks fly, but the door remains locked. An alarm suddenly blares from the panel, flashing a red light. You have alerted the entire Legion camp to your location.
[[Run for your life->MountainDescent]]
[[Stand and fight->MountainDoorLastStand]]

:: SaltFlatsEdge-Alone
You leave Moth to her repairs and continue across the blinding white plain alone. The silence is absolute. The Sunken Library is a dark speck on the horizon, a goal that feels very far away.
[[Approach the Library cautiously->LibraryApproachAlone]]
[[Circle wide to scout for Choir patrols->SaltFlatsCircle]]

:: SaltFlatsSneak
While the Choir zealots approach Moth's skiff, you use the salt formations as cover to slip past unnoticed. Your path toward the Sunken Library is clear, but you have left Moth to face the zealots alone.
[[Reach the Library alone->LibraryApproachAlone]]

:: SearchForVale-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
Lyra leads you to search for Dr. Vale, hoping his knowledge can unlock the two fragments.
[[Head east toward the Whispering Rocks->ValeHidingPlace-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]
:: SkiffWarning
You run toward the skiff, waving your arms. "Moth! Behind you!" Moth spins around, sees the approaching Choir zealots, and abandons her repair work. She grabs a pack and meets you halfway. "No time to fix it! Run!" The two of you flee across the salt as the zealots descend on the abandoned skiff.
[[Escape into the salt flats->SaltFlatsEscape-WithMoth]]

:: TowerRuinTalk1
"How do you know about the map?" you ask, wary. Lyra smiles cryptically. "The data-streams whisper. The Union exiles me, but I still listen. The Legion hunts for it. The Nomads fear it. You carry a weight greater than you know."
[[Ask about the Legion's interest->TowerRuinTalk2]]
[[Show her the fragment->TowerRuinTalk2]]
:: TowerRuinTalk1-Beacon
"What do you mean?" you ask. Lyra gestures to the barren landscape. "You're not here for scraps. You're looking for a way to change this. The map to Haven-0. I can help you read it. The old-world cartography is encrypted."
[[Ask how she can help->TowerRuinTalk2]]
[[Decline her offer and leave->CommTowerExit]]

:: TowerRuinTalk2
You show Lyra the scorched map fragment. Her eyes widen with recognition. "The encryption is old Union code. I can help you decipher it, but it's dangerous knowledge. The Legion will kill for this." She looks from the fragment to your face, gauging your resolve.
[[Accept her offer of help->TowerRuinTalk-Join]]
[[Decline her help and continue alone->TowerRuinTalk-Leave]]
:: TrailTalk1
"What can you tell me about the Ashen Choir?" you ask. Lyra's expression darkens. "They are a death cult. They believe the ash is a divine punishment and that any attempt to reverse it is blasphemy. They are dangerously zealous and guard old sites fiercely."
[[Ask about the Technic Union->TrailTalk2]]

:: TrailTalk2
"Why were you exiled from the Union?" you inquire. Lyra sighs. "I believed their knowledge should be shared to help survivors. They believe it must be hoarded to rebuild their power. I read the storms to warn people. They called it meddling. We disagreed."
[[Ask about the map fragments again->TrailTalkFragments]]

:: TrailTalkMoth1
"Tell me about the Dustborn," you say as you walk. Moth's face lights up. "We are the children of the waste. We don't hide in bunkers or build walls. We move with the wind. We remember the stories of the old world, but we live in the new one."
[[Ask about the Sunken Library->TrailTalkMoth2]]

:: TrailTalkMoth2
"The Sunken Library is an old university archive," Moth explains. "The Ashen Choir claims it as a holy site. They say the knowledge inside is cursed. But my people believe one of the map fragments is there, protected by a ghost—an old scientist."
[[Ask about the ghost->TrailTalkMoth3]]

:: UnionFacilityEntrance
You dive through the doorway as turret fire ricochets around you. The door slams shut behind, cutting off the Legion. You are in a sterile, brightly lit corridor. Alarms blare. Lyra is with you, looking around in awe. "A fully active Union facility. I haven't been in one of these since my exile."
[[Explore the facility->UnionFacilityExplore-WithLyra]]

:: ValeDiscussion
[[Take the final fragment and commit->ValeJoins-WithLyra-HasAllFragments-MetOren-Discussed]]
:: CavernGuardAttack
You leap from hiding, tackling the lone Legion guard before he can raise the alarm. The struggle is silent and quick. With him subdued, you stand before the sealed Union door. It is locked tight, and Lyra is trapped inside with Captain Hale.
[[Attempt to find a way to open the door->UnionDoorGuard]]
[[Abandon the door and flee the cavern->CanyonExit]]

:: CommTowerExit
"You travel your own path," Lyra says, respecting your decision. She turns and walks away, soon disappearing into the folds of the wasteland. You are alone again at the base of the dead tower, the weight of your quest feeling heavier than before.
[[Head toward the Rust-Ridge mountains->RustRidgeFoothills]]
[[Set out for the salt flats->SaltFlatsEdge]]

:: GeoCoreCavern-HasDatapad
You approach the glowing crystal shard on its pedestal. A holographic figure flickers to life—an old man in a lab coat. "I am Dr. Oren Vale," the recording states. "Haven-0 is real, but its power requires a ultimate sacrifice." The fragment pulses with potential.
[[Take the second map fragment->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
[[Listen to the full message->ValeRecording-HasDatapad]]
:: GeoCoreCavernRace-WithLyra-HasDatapad
[[Grab the fragment and run->GeoCoreFragmentGrab-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: GeoCoreFragmentAbandoned
You leave the fragment on the pedestal, unwilling to bear the cost of its power. The hologram of Dr. Vale fades. The main vault door remains sealed. You have gained nothing but a grim warning, and the Legion is still outside.
[[Exit the vault through the maintenance tunnel->RidgeDescent-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreGantryDefense-WithLyra-HasDatapad
You and Lyra take cover on the high gantry, firing down at the Legion scouts below. The fragment remains on the cavern floor.
[[Continue suppressing fire->GantryFirefightContinued-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
[[Make a dash for the fragment->GantryDash-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: GeoCoreVentEntry-HasDatapad
[[Follow the corridor toward the main cavern->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-HasDatapad]]
:: LibraryApproachAlone
You approach the low, dome-like structure of the Sunken Library alone. There is no sign of Moth or the Nomads. Ashen Choir sentries patrol with a rigid, fanatical dedication. Getting inside unnoticed will be nearly impossible.
[[Attempt to parley with the guards->LibraryParleyAlone]]
[[Look for a hidden weakness in the perimeter->LibraryInfiltrateAlone]]

:: LibraryArchives
The archives are a labyrinth of towering shelves, packed with decaying books and data-slates. The air is thick with dust. Finding a single data-cube here is a daunting task. You begin a slow, methodical search, aware that you are an intruder in a sacred place.
[[Search the eastern stacks->LibraryArchivesEast]]
[[Search the western stacks->LibraryArchivesWest]]

:: LibraryCentral
The central chamber is illuminated by softly glowing fungi. In the center, a stone altar stands empty. The room is silent, save for the faint sound of chanting from a nearby corridor. The fragment must be close, but this chamber is not its resting place.
[[Follow the sound of chanting->LibraryCentralConfront]]
[[Search the altar for hidden compartments->LibraryCentralSearch]]

:: LibraryCentralConfront
You step into the chamber where the chanting is loudest. An Ashen Choir High Priestess is placing a data-cube on a central altar, surrounded by acolytes. She turns, her eyes burning with fervor. "You profane this holy space! The Oracle's word is not for you!"
[[Demand the map fragment->LibraryCentralDemand]]
[[Attempt to reason with the Priestess->LibraryCentralReason]]

:: LibraryCentralSteal
You move like a shadow along the wall, staying behind the pillars. The chanting acolyte is deep in meditation. You reach the altar and your fingers close around the cool metal of the data-cube. Just as you lift it, the acolyte's eyes snap open.
[[Run for it->LibraryEscape-Alone]]
[[Face the acolyte->LibraryCentralFight]]

:: LibraryEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You and Moth run through the twisting corridors of the Library, the shouts of the Sentries echoing behind you. You burst out into the blinding light of the salt flats, the third fragment secure. Dr. Vale stumbles after you, confused but free.
[[Escape into the wastes->SaltFlatsEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: LibraryFight-WithMoth
You stand your ground against the Choir Sentinel. Moth joins you, a determined look on her face. The fight is short and brutal. The Sentinel is skilled, but you are desperate. You manage to disarm him, forcing a retreat, but you have made a powerful enemy.
[[Enter the Library->LibraryEntrance-WithMoth]]

:: MarketAlleyStranger
You turn to face a grizzled man with a scar across his face. He wears a patch from the Technic Union. "A map like that is worth dying for," he says, his voice low. "The Union could protect you. Or the Legion will take it from your corpse. Your choice."
[[Hear his offer->MarketAlleyUnionOffer]]
[[Threaten him to back off->MarketAlleyThreaten]]

:: MarketArgumentIntervene
You step between the Legion officer and the Nomads. "They've said they don't know anything. Pressuring them won't help." The officer turns his cold gaze on you. "Interfering in Legion business is a capital offense. Consider this your only warning."
[[Stand down and apologize->MarketArgumentApology]]
[[Continue to defend the Nomads->MarketArgumentDefend]]

:: MarketNomadsLibrary
"The Sunken Library is a place of old knowledge," the Nomad says cautiously. "But the Ashen Choir guards it. They believe the texts are sacred. If you go there, do not go with violence in your heart, or you will not return."
[[Ask for directions->MarketNomadsDirections]]
[[Thank them and leave->OutpostMarket]]

:: MarketNomadsTrade
You offer a working energy cell. The Nomads confer. "This is good," one says. "We will trade. A rumor: the Legion is digging near the Rust-Ridge. They seek a vault. And the Technic Union is angry about it." The information is valuable, if vague.
[[Accept the rumor as payment->MarketNomadsRumor]]
[[Press for more specific details->MarketNomadsPress]]

:: MountainDescent
The blaring alarm leaves you no choice. You turn and run back down the mountain, away from the personnel door. Legion shouts and gunfire follow you. It is a frantic, stumbling retreat, your chance to enter the vault lost for now.
[[Escape into the foothills->RustRidgeFoothills]]

:: MountainDoorLastStand
The Legion soldiers swarm you. You fight bravely but are overcome by their numbers. Your journey ends here, on the mountainside, and Haven-0 falls to Captain Hale's control.
[[Fight to the bitter end->Ending-LegionCaptive]]
:: MountainDoorStand
You decide to make a stand, using the door as cover. The Legion soldiers approach cautiously, spreading out. The first shots ring out, sparking against the metal door. You are outnumbered and outgunned, with nowhere to run.
[[Fight until the end->MountainDoorLastStand]]
[[Attempt to surrender->MountainDoorSurrender]]

:: MountainFissureEntry
You squeeze into the narrow fissure. It descends into pitch blackness. After a treacherous climb down, you find yourself in a small, dead-end cavern. The air is stale. The fissure does not connect to the vault. You are trapped.
[[Attempt to climb back out->MountainSummitSearch]]
[[Rest and consider your options->MountainFissureWait]]

:: PersonnelDoorApproach
You reach the personnel door unseen. It is a solid slab of metal with a keypad. There is no visible handle or manual override. It requires a code to open, and you do not have it.
[[Try to guess the code->PersonnelDoorGuess]]
[[Search the area for a clue->PersonnelDoorSearch]]

:: PersonnelDoorForce-HasDatapad
[[Enter the vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-HasDatapad]]
:: SaltFlatsEdge-WithMoth
The salt flats stretch before you and Moth, a blinding white expanse under the gloomy sky. The air is still and heavy. Moth points to the horizon. "The Library is that way. The Choir guards it fiercely, but the fragment is inside." The path is clear but dangerous.
[[Approach the Library openly under a flag of parley->LibraryParley-WithMoth]]
[[Look for a hidden way in, avoiding the sentries->LibraryInfiltrate-WithMoth]]

You, Moth, and Dr. Vale flee the Library with the third fragment.
[[Head for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
:: TowerBaseTalk1
"What do you want?" you ask, hand near your weapon. Lyra remains calm. "An alliance. The Legion is a threat to us both. I have skills you need to read that map. Together, we might actually find Haven-0 before Captain Hale turns it into a fortress."
[[Consider her proposal->TowerBaseTalk2]]
[[Reject her and walk away->CommTowerExit]]

:: TowerBaseTalk2
[[Go alone->WastelandTrail]]
:: TrailTalkFragments
"The fragments are keys," Lyra explains. "But also triggers. Together, they don't just show the way to Haven-0; they activate its systems. That's why everyone wants them. Control the fragments, control the future."
[[Ask about the final fragment's location->TrailTalkFinalFragment]]
[[Ponder the weight of this knowledge->TrailTalkPonder]]

:: TrailTalkMoth3
"The ghost is Dr. Oren Vale," Moth says, her voice dropping. "The Nomads say he hid himself in the Library to protect the fragment. He's been there since the Cataclysm, half-mad from isolation. But he might be the only one who truly understands Haven-0."
[[Ask if Vale can be reasoned with->TrailTalkMoth4]]
[[Express doubt about finding a madman->TrailTalkMoth5]]

:: UnionFacilityExplore-WithLyra
The facility is a marvel of old-world technology, clean and humming with power. Lyra leads the way, her knowledge of Union layouts evident. "This is a research outpost," she says. "They were studying the ashfall. There might be data here that can help us."

"I cannot be responsible for such destruction," you say, leaving the final fragment. Dr. Vale watches you, his expression unreadable. "Then the world will remain as it is." You abandon the cave and its hope.
[[Leave the subway tunnel and return to the wastes->ForbiddenZoneExit-Abandoned]]
:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You, Moth, and Dr. Vale stand at the edge of the nightmare landscape. The three map fragments in your pack hum with a painful intensity, pulling you toward the heart of the storm. The air crackles with latent energy, and the ground trembles. Dr. Vale points a trembling finger. "The door is in the storm. The key is in the heart we bring to it." Moth steadies herself. "We have three keys. We go together."

:: GantryFirefight-WithLyra-HasDatapad
From the gantry, you return fire on the Legion scouts below. Your shots ricochet off the cavern floor, forcing them to take cover. Lyra provides supporting fire with her energy staff. You have the high ground, but you are pinned. The map fragment remains tantalizingly out of reach on the pedestal.

[[Retreat to the gantry for a better position->GeoCoreGantryDefense-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren-LockedIn
You and Lyra scramble up the maintenance tunnel to the mountainside, the sounds of the sealed vault fading below. You emerge onto the mountain's northern face, the wind whipping around you. You have the second fragment, but you are locked out of the main vault, and the Legion is still encamped at the main entrance.
[[Descend the mountain carefully->RidgeDescent-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
[[Wait for nightfall to bypass the Legion camp->RidgeDescentNight-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]

You snatch the second map fragment from the pedestal. The Legion scouts open fire. Lyra provides covering fire as you both retreat toward the maintenance tunnel.
[[Escape through the tunnel->GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-Grabbed]]
:: GeoCoreFragmentTaken-HasDatapad-MetOren
You take the second map fragment. It fits with the first, revealing more of the route to Haven-0. The hologram of Dr. Vale fades. Suddenly, the main vault door grinds open—the Legion has finally broken through. Captain Hale stands in the entrance, his soldiers fanning out into the cavern.
[[Confront Hale alone->GeoCoreConfrontation-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
[[Flee through the maintenance tunnel->RidgeDescent-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
:: LibraryArchivesEast
The eastern stacks are a jumble of collapsed shelves and water-damaged texts. The air is thick with mold. After a long search, you find only fragments of geological surveys, nothing resembling a data-cube. Your time here is running out.
[[Search the western stacks->LibraryArchivesWest]]
[[Abandon the archives and try the central chamber->LibraryCentral]]

:: LibraryArchivesWest
[[Take the data-cube->LibraryFragmentTaken-MetOren-West]]
:: LibraryCentralDemand
"Give me the map fragment," you command, stepping toward the altar. The High Priestess smiles, a cold, terrible expression. "You demand nothing here, unbeliever. The Oracle's legacy is dust, as all things shall be." She signals her acolytes, who draw ceremonial blades.
[[Prepare for a fight->LibraryCentralFight]]
[[Attempt a last-second negotiation->LibraryCentralReason]]

:: LibraryCentralFight
The acolyte leaps from the altar with unexpected speed, a curved knife in hand. The fight is swift and brutal in the fungal glow. You manage to disarm them, but the noise will surely attract more Choir guards.
[[Take the cube and run->LibraryEscape-Alone]]
[[Hide the body and attempt to remain stealthy->LibraryCentralSearch]]

:: LibraryCentralReason
"We don't have to be enemies," you say, lowering your weapon. "Haven-0 can save everyone, even the Choir." The Priestess hesitates, her fervor warring with logic. "Salvation is an illusion. The ash is truth. But... your conviction is... unusual." She hasn't ordered the attack yet.

The stone altar is solid, but your search reveals a hidden compartment beneath it. Inside lies not a data-cube, but an old journal. It contains notes by Dr. Vale, speaking of a "fail-safe" at Haven-0. The fragment must be elsewhere.
[[Take the journal and continue searching->LibraryArchives]]
[[Confront the acolyte after all->LibraryCentralConfront]]

:: LibraryEntrance-WithMoth
You and Moth step into the main hall of the Sunken Library. The air is still and sanctified. Robed figures move in the shadows at the far end, but your path inside is clear for now. The search for the fragment begins.
[[Head for the archives->LibraryArchives-WithMoth]]
[[Move toward the central chamber->LibraryCentral-WithMoth]]

:: LibraryEscape-Alone
You clutch the data-cube and run, the shouts of the acolyte ringing in your ears. You burst out of the Library into the blinding salt flats, pursued by zealous cries. You have the third fragment, but you are alone and exposed.
[[Flee into the wastes->SaltFlatsEscape-Alone]]
[[Try to find a place to hide->SaltFlatsHide-Alone]]

:: LibraryInfiltrateAlone
You find a crack in the Library's foundation, hidden by a petrified salt formation. Squeezing through, you enter a dark, dusty storage room. You are inside, but the way forward is a maze of silent, ominous corridors.
[[Search for the archives->LibraryArchives]]
[[Follow the sound of chanting->LibraryCentral]]

:: LibraryParleyAlone
You approach the sentries with hands raised. "I seek knowledge, not conflict." The lead Sentinel stares, his face a mask of contempt. "The ash provides all knowledge. Your presence defiles it. Leave, or be cleansed." His grip on his weapon tightens.
[[Retreat and try infiltration->LibraryInfiltrateAlone]]
[[Stand your ground, ready to fight->LibraryFight-Alone]]

:: MarketAlleyThreaten
"Back off," you snarl, drawing your own weapon. "This map is mine." The Union man chuckles, unimpressed. "Brave. And foolish. The waste is full of brave fools. Remember this when the Legion comes for you." He turns and melts into the market crowd, leaving you wary and alone.
[[Leave the alley quickly->OutpostMarket]]
[[Check to see if you were followed->MarketAlleyFollow]]

:: MarketAlleyUnionOffer
"The Union offers sanctuary," the man says. "And resources. In return, you share what you find. We are the last best hope for restoring knowledge. The Legion only destroys." He presents a small comms device. "Use this if you change your mind."
[[Accept the comms device->MarketAlleyUnionAccept]]
[[Refuse the offer->MarketAlleyUnionRefuse]]

:: MarketArgumentApology
"My apologies, officer," you say, stepping back. "I meant no interference." The officer grunts, turning his attention back to the Nomads. "Wise choice. Now, where were we?" You have avoided a direct confrontation, but the Nomads are still under pressure.
[[Slip away unnoticed->MarketAlley]]
[[Wait and see if the Nomads need further help->MarketArgumentWatch]]

:: MarketArgumentDefend
"They have a right to remain neutral," you insist, standing firm. The Legion officer's face darkens with anger. "You have just chosen a side." He signals to two other Legionaries nearby. The situation is about to turn violent.
[[Prepare for a fight->MarketFight]]
[[Try to de-escalate one last time->MarketArgumentApology]]

:: MarketNomadsDirections
"Follow the salt flats west for two days," the Nomad says quietly. "You will see a low, dome-like structure of stone. That is the Library. But listen—do not go to the main entrance. Look for a crack in the north wall, behind the salt spikes."
[[Thank them for the information->OutpostMarket]]
[[Offer a gift in return->MarketNomadsTrade]]

:: MarketNomadsPress
"The Legion is digging at the base of the largest peak in the Rust-Ridge," the Nomad relents. "The one they call 'Skybreaker.' The Union is watching from a hidden outpost to the east. That is all we know."
[[Accept this information->MarketNomadsRumor]]
[[Thank them and take your leave->OutpostMarket]]

:: MarketNomadsRumor
You accept the rumor about the Legion and the Union. The Nomad nods. "Travel safely, Wanderer. The roads are watched." The information gives you a clear, if dangerous, destination: the Skybreaker mountain in the Rust-Ridge.
[[Head for the Rust-Ridge mountains->RustRidgeFoothills]]
[[Stay in the outpost to learn more->OutpostMarket]]

:: MountainDoorSurrender
You drop your weapon and raise your hands. "I surrender." The Legion soldiers approach cautiously, securing your arms. Captain Hale climbs the path to meet you. "A sensible choice. Unfortunately, you've seen too much." His expression offers no hope of mercy.
[[Resign yourself to capture->Ending-LegionCaptive]]
[[Make a desperate last move->MountainDoorLastStand]]

:: MountainFissureWait
Trapped in the dead-end cavern, you rest against the cool rock. The air is limited. Panic begins to itch at the edge of your mind. You must find a way out or succumb to despair and thirst.
[[Attempt to dig at the cavern walls->MountainFissureDig]]
[[Call for help, though it seems hopeless->MountainFissureCall]]

:: NomadCache-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
Dr. Vale is with you. The three fragments are secured.
[[Plot a course for the Vault of Lament->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
:: PersonnelDoorGuess
You try a few common access codes: 0000, 1234, 9999. The keypad beeps red each time. On the third failed attempt, a soft alarm sounds from within the door mechanism. You have drawn attention to yourself.
[[Run before guards arrive->MountainDescent]]
[[Prepare to fight whoever comes->PersonnelDoorAmbush]]

:: PersonnelDoorSearch
You search the area around the personnel door. Hidden under a loose rock, you find a small, weathered logbook. The last entry reads: "Emergency code for Sector 7: 7-3-0-1." It might be the code for the door.
[[Try the code 7301->PersonnelDoorCodeAttempt]]
[[Consider the risk of the code being outdated->PersonnelDoorRisk]]

:: RidgeDescent-HasDatapad-MetOren
You descend the mountain alone, the datapad and the encounter with Vale's hologram heavy memories. The path to the final fragment is long and dangerous.
[[Head for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
:: RustRidgeFoothills-WithMoth
The mountains loom, and Moth points out a hidden goat trail that winds upward. "The Nomads use this to avoid Legion patrols. It will take us to a high overlook above the GeoCore Vault." The climb is steep, but the path is secret.
[[Take the hidden trail->MountainAscent-WithMoth]]
[[Scout the Legion's position from the foothills->MountainVantage-WithMoth]]

:: SaltFlatsWalk-WithMoth
You and Moth abandon the skiff, opting for a quieter approach on foot. The salt crunches under your boots. Progress is slow, but stealthy. The Library grows larger on the horizon, its details becoming clearer.
[[Approach the Library's north wall, as the Nomads suggested->LibraryInfiltrate-WithMoth]]
[[Observe the patrol patterns from a distance->LibraryObservation-WithMoth]]

:: TrailTalkFinalFragment
"The final fragment is the most dangerous," Lyra says. "It's in the Forbidden Zone, at the edge of the world. The data-streams show constant energy storms there. Nothing survives for long. Reaching it will require luck, skill, or sacrifice."
[[Ask if there's any way to prepare->TrailTalkPrepare]]
[[Accept the danger as necessary->TrailTalkAccept]]

:: TrailTalkMoth4
"Vale is a scientist, not a monster," Moth assures you. "The Nomads believe he wants Haven-0 to succeed, but he's afraid of what it will cost. If we can show him we understand the sacrifice, he might help us."
[[Ask what the sacrifice entails->TrailTalkMoth5]]
[[Express confidence in your resolve->TrailTalkResolve]]

:: TrailTalkMoth5
"The stories are all we have," Moth says. "But I believe them. I believe we can find Vale and convince him." Her faith is unwavering as you trek across the waste.
[[Press on toward the Library->SaltFlatsEdge-WithMoth]]
:: TrailTalkPonder
[[Continue toward the Salt Flats->SaltFlatsEdge-WithLyra-Ponder]]
:: UnionDoorGuard
You search the unconscious guard, finding a keycard on his belt. You swipe it against the Union door's reader. A light blinks green, and the door slides open. Inside, you see Captain Hale and his soldiers interrogating Lyra in a brightly lit corridor.
[[Charge in to rescue Lyra->UnionFacilityRescue]]
[[Use the element of surprise for an ambush->UnionFacilityAmbush]]

:: UnionFacilityArchive-WithLyra
The archive is a vast room of blinking servers. Lyra interfaces her datapad, downloading data rapidly. "This outpost was studying the ash's composition. Their findings are... alarming. The toxicity is increasing. Haven-0 isn't just a hope; it's a necessity."
[[Search for data on Haven-0's location->ArchiveHavenData-WithLyra]]
[[Look for information on the final fragment->ArchiveFragmentData-WithLyra]]

:: UnionFacilityLabs-WithLyra
The labs contain eerie specimens preserved in tanks: mutated flora and fauna from the wastes. Lyra examines a console. "They were trying to engineer a resistant strain of crop. They failed. This place is a monument to good intentions and dead ends."
[[Search for usable technology->LabScavenge-WithLyra]]
[[Return to the archive for more relevant data->UnionFacilityArchive-WithLyra]]

:: UnionOutpostSearch-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
[[Take the map and head for the Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]
:: ArchiveFragmentData-WithLyra
Lyra downloads data on the fragments. "The files confirm three other locations: the GeoCore Vault, the Sunken Library, and a place called the Vault of Lament in the Forbidden Zone. The fourth is the key to them all."
[[Head out to find Dr. Vale, who may know more->UnionOutpost-WithLyra]]
:: ArchiveHavenData-WithLyra
"The Haven-0 coordinates are here," Lyra says, her voice filled with awe. "It's in a valley shielded by magnetic anomalies. No wonder it was never found. But the files confirm Vale's warning. The activation sequence describes a core meltdown. It's designed to be a single-use event."
[[Download the coordinates->ArchiveHavenDataDownload-WithLyra]]
[[Look for information on bypassing the self-destruct->ArchiveHavenDataBypass-WithLyra]]

:: Ending-LegionCaptive
The Legion soldiers bind your hands and march you to their land-train. You are thrown into a dark, metal cell. Captain Hale looks in one last time. "Your journey ends here, Wanderer. The map fragments will be found on your body, and Haven-0 will serve the Legion's order." The door clangs shut, and the vehicle rumbles to life. You are taken to a Legion labor camp, where you spend the rest of your days, a forgotten prisoner of a war you tried to avoid.
:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You stand alone at the edge of the Forbidden Zone, the two map fragments humming persistently. The memory of Vale's holographic warning is a heavy burden. The final key lies somewhere in that maelstrom, a solitary quest.
[[Enter the storm alone->ZoneStormEntry-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
[[Search for a longer route along the unstable perimeter->ZoneCircuitousRoute-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: GantryDash-WithLyra-HasDatapad
You slide down to the cavern floor and grab the fragment while Lyra covers you. Legion fire intensifies.
[[Escape back to the tunnel->GeoCoreFragmentGrab-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: GantryFirefightContinued-WithLyra-HasDatapad
The firefight continues, but you and Lyra are running low on ammunition and energy. The Legion scouts are pinned but not defeated. A sudden grinding sound echoes through the cavern—the main vault door is being forced open. More Legion troops are arriving. "We can't win this," Lyra shouts. "We have to retreat!"
[[Retreat back up the maintenance tunnel to escape->GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-Retreat]]
:: GeoCoreConfrontation-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
Captain Hale stands in the shattered doorway, his soldiers fanning out. He sees the fragment in your hand. "Alone? That was unwise." He levels his pistol. "The fragment, now. Your cooperation will be noted."
[[Refuse to surrender->ConfrontationRefuse]]
[[Attempt to negotiate->ConfrontationNegotiate]]

:: GeoCoreMainExitAttempt-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
[[Turn and fight the scouts->GeoCoreCavernFight-WithLyra-HasDatapad]]
:: LabScavenge-WithLyra
You search the lab benches, finding a few usable energy cells and a portable environmental scanner. "This could be useful in the Forbidden Zone," Lyra notes, pocketing the scanner. But you find nothing directly related to your main quest.
[[Return to the archive->UnionFacilityArchive-WithLyra]]
[[Leave the facility and continue your journey->UnionFacilityExit-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryArchives-MetOren
The archives are vast and silent. Dr. Vale is not here.
[[Search the eastern stacks->LibraryArchivesEast]]
[[Search the western stacks->LibraryArchivesWest]]
:: LibraryCentralReason2
"The Choir survives, but does it thrive?" you ask, pressing your advantage. "The ash chokes everyone equally. What if Haven-0 could give your people a choice? A world where the ash is a memory, not a master." The Priestess stares, her fervor wavering. "A choice... we have forgotten choice."
[[Reach for the cube slowly->LibraryCentralReasonTake]]
[[Continue to argue your case->LibraryCentralReason3]]

:: LibraryFight-Alone
You stand your ground as the Sentinel advances. The fight is fierce and solitary. You are skilled, but the Sentinel is a fanatic, fighting without fear. You manage to land a crippling blow, but not before taking a deep gash to your arm. You are wounded, but the path into the Library is now open.
[[Enter the Library, bleeding but determined->LibraryEntrance-Alone]]
[[Retreat to tend to your wound->SaltFlatsEdge-Alone]]

:: LibraryFragmentTaken-MetOren
You take the data-cube. The old man whimpers.
[[Flee the archives->LibraryEscape-Alone]]
[[Try to explain to the acolyte->LibraryAcolyteConfront]]
:: LibraryObservation-WithMoth
You and Moth find a ridge overlooking the Library. Through a salvaged scope, you watch the patrols. They follow a rigid, predictable pattern. There's a gap in their coverage every ten minutes near the north wall, exactly where the Nomads said a crack would be.
[[Time your approach to use the gap->LibraryInfiltrate-WithMoth]]
[[Wait for nightfall for even better cover->LibraryInfiltrateNight-WithMoth]]

:: MarketAlleyFollow
You peer out from the alley, scanning the market crowd. The Union man is gone, but you see a Legion soldier watching the alley's mouth casually. You've been marked. They know you have something valuable.
[[Confront the soldier->MarketAlleyConfront]]
[[Duck back into the alley and find another way out->OutpostWalls]]

:: MarketAlleyUnionAccept
You take the comms device. "Wise," the Union man says. "Tune to frequency 7.1 if you need extraction or technical support. Don't trust the Legion." He nods and disappears into the crowd. You have a potential ally, but also a tether to a powerful faction.
[[Return to the market->OutpostMarket]]
[[Leave the outpost immediately->WastelandTrail]]

:: MarketAlleyUnionRefuse
"I make my own path," you say. The Union man shrugs. "A lonely path. Very well. But remember, the Union's offer stands. The waste is less forgiving than we are." He turns and is gone. You are left with your map and your independence.
[[Return to the market->OutpostMarket]]
[[Leave the outpost->WastelandTrail]]

:: MarketArgumentWatch
You linger at a nearby stall, pretending to browse but watching the argument. The Legion officer finally tires of the Nomads' defiance. He confiscates their trade goods as a "tax" and leaves. The Nomads look defeated and angry. You could approach them now, when they are most upset with the Legion.
[[Approach the sympathetic Nomads->MarketNomads]]
[[Slip away, not wanting to get involved further->MarketAlley]]

:: MarketFight
You draw your weapon as the Legionaries advance. The market erupts into chaos. Stall owners duck for cover. The fight is a frantic melee in the crowded space. You are badly outnumbered.
[[Fight to the death->Ending-MarketDeath]]
[[Try to break away and flee the outpost->MarketEscape]]

:: MountainAscent-WithMoth
Moth leads you up the hidden trail. It's steep and narrow, but she moves with sure-footed confidence. "The Legion never checks up here," she whispers. The trail leads to a ledge directly above the GeoCore Vault's main entrance, giving you a perfect view of the Legion camp below.
[[Descend from the ledge to attack the camp->MountainLedgeAttack-WithMoth]]
[[Use the vantage point to plan a stealthy entry->MountainVantage-WithMoth]]

:: MountainFissureCall
You shout for help, your voice echoing uselessly in the small, dead-end cavern. No answer comes except the sound of your own panicked breathing. The air is growing stale. Your situation is dire.
[[Conserve your energy and air->MountainFissureWait]]
[[Make one more desperate attempt to climb out->MountainSummitSearch]]

:: MountainFissureDig
You use your knife and hands to scrape at the cavern wall, hoping to find a weak point or connect to another passage. The rock is unyielding. You only succeed in exhausting yourself and dulling your blade. Hope begins to fade.
[[Rest and accept your fate->Ending-Trapped]]
[[Try calling for help again->MountainFissureCall]]

:: MountainVantage-WithMoth
From your high perch with Moth, you see the entire Legion operation. The main door is heavily guarded, but you also spot a ventilation shaft on the mountainside, partially obscured by scrub. It's not on any Legion schematic. It could be a way in.
[[Have Moth create a distraction while you reach the shaft->MountainDistractionEntry-WithMoth]]
[[Descend and attempt to open the shaft together->MountainVentEntry-WithMoth]]

:: OutpostSearchMore-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
[[Take the journal and follow the clue to the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]
:: PersonnelDoorAmbush
You press against the rock face beside the door, weapon ready. A single Legion soldier arrives to investigate the alarm. As he scans the empty area, you strike, subduing him quickly and quietly. The door remains locked, but you have eliminated a witness.
[[Try the code you found on the soldier->PersonnelDoorCodeAttempt]]
[[Drag the body away and hide->PersonnelDoorHide]]

:: PersonnelDoorCodeAttempt
[[Enter the vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-HasDatapad-Code]]
:: PersonnelDoorRisk
The code in the logbook is old. It might not work, or it might trigger a security response. Using it is a gamble. The Legion patrols will be alerted by the earlier alarm soon. You need to decide.
[[Risk using the code->PersonnelDoorCodeAttempt]]
[[Abandon the door and retreat->MountainDescent]]

:: RidgeDescentNight-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
[[Head for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: SaltFlatsEscape-Alone
You run across the blinding white plain, the cries of the Choir fading behind you. You have the third fragment, but you are alone, wounded, and exposed on the open salt. The journey to the final fragment will be a solitary trial.
[[Press on toward the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
[[Find a place to rest and recover->SaltFlatsHide-Alone]]

:: SaltFlatsHide-Alone
You find a shallow depression in the salt, enough to conceal you from distant view. You tend to your wounds and rest, the data-cube heavy in your pack. The Sunken Library is a dark smudge on the horizon, but your immediate need is survival.
[[Continue your journey after resting->SaltFlatsEdge-Alone]]
[[Wait for nightfall to travel->SaltFlatsNight-Alone]]

:: TrailTalkAccept
"Some risks are necessary," you say, your voice firm. Lyra nods, a grim respect in her eyes. "Then we prepare as best we can. I'll monitor the storm patterns. We'll find a window, however small."
[[Ask what preparations can be made->TrailTalkPrepare]]
[[Continue the journey in determined silence->TrailTalkSilence]]

:: TrailTalkCommit
"The Library is our best lead," you say to Moth. She nods, her usual optimism tempered by the danger. "Then we go. I know a path that might avoid the worst of the patrols." You set out across the salt.
[[Set out for the Sunken Library->SaltFlatsEdge-WithMoth]]

[[Continue the journey toward the next challenge->SaltFlatsEdge-WithLyra-Cope]]

[[Detour to the abandoned Union outpost->UnionOutpost-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-Prepared]]
:: TrailTalkResolve
"Then we find Vale and show him our resolve," you declare. Moth's face brightens. "Good! The Nomads say the way to the heart is through respect, not force." You adjust your course toward the salt flats.
[[Journey to the Salt Flats->SaltFlatsEdge-WithMoth]]
:: TrailTalkSilence
You and Moth walk in silence, the crunch of salt underfoot the only sound. The Library is a dark speck on the horizon, a goal that requires no words. The understanding between you is enough.
[[Approach the edge of the Salt Flats->SaltFlatsEdge-WithMoth]]
:: UnionFacilityAmbush
You wait just inside the doorway, hidden in the shadows. As Captain Hale and his soldiers drag Lyra down the corridor, you leap out, attacking from behind. The surprise is total. You take down one soldier before they even know you're there.
[[Grapple with Hale to free Lyra->UnionFacilityRescue]]
[[Focus on cutting Lyra's bonds so she can fight->UnionFacilityCutBonds]]

:: UnionFacilityRescue
You charge Captain Hale, knocking him off balance. Lyra uses the distraction to knee her captor and break free. The sterile corridor becomes a close-quarters battlefield. You and Lyra are fighting back to back against the Legion squad.
[[Fight your way to an exit->UnionFacilityEscape-WithLyra]]
[[Try to secure the facility and lock the Legion out->UnionFacilitySecure]]

:: UnionOutpost-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
The silent outpost yields a clue: a note from Vale pointing to the Vault of Lament.
[[Take the note and follow the route->ForbiddenZoneEdge-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
Moth leads you on a long, winding path around the perimeter of the Zone. It takes hours, but it avoids the worst of the visible energy storms. You finally approach the vault entrance from the rear, where the ground is more stable and there are no immediate threats.
[[Approach the vault's rear entrance->ZoneVaultRear-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultApproach-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You guide the sand-skiff directly toward the dark opening. Energy arcs crackle around you, and the skiff's instruments flicker. Moth struggles to keep control. "This is it! The Vault of Lament!" she shouts over the storm. The entrance yawns before you, a mouth of rock and darkness.
[[Drive the skiff straight into the vault->ZoneVaultEntry-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
[[Abandon the skiff and proceed on foot->ZoneVaultFootApproach-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ArchiveHavenDataBypass-WithLyra
Lyra frowns at the console. "The self-destruct is hard-coded into the core programming. It's not a safety feature; it's the primary power source. A controlled matter-antimatter annihilation. There is no bypass. The files are very clear."
[[Accept the grim reality->UnionFacilityExit-WithLyra]]
[[Look for any other useful data before leaving->UnionFacilityArchive-WithLyra]]

:: ArchiveHavenDataDownload-WithLyra
Lyra downloads the coordinates and technical schematics onto her datapad. "We have the location. Now we know for certain what we face. The path ends at a controlled explosion that will consume Haven-0." The data is a heavy addition to your pack.
[[Leave the facility with the new knowledge->UnionFacilityExit-WithLyra]]

:: Ending-MarketDeath
The Legion soldiers are disciplined and ruthless. You fight bravely, but you are outnumbered and surrounded in the market square. A shot to the leg brings you down, and the final blow is swift. The last thing you see is a Legionary pulling the scorched map fragment from your jacket. Your quest dies with you in the dust of the outpost.

:: Ending-Trapped
The air in the fissure grows thin. Your attempts to dig or climb have failed. Darkness creeps at the edge of your vision as you succumb to thirst and suffocation. The map fragment, a key to the world's future, is buried with you in a forgotten crack of the mountain.

:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
Alone and wounded, you stare into the chaotic maelstrom of the Forbidden Zone. The three map fragments in your pack hum with a painful intensity, pulling you toward the heart of the storm. The path is suicide for a single person, but turning back is no longer an option.
[[Enter the storm alone->ZoneStormEntry-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
[[Search for a path along the zone's edge->ZoneCircuitousRoute-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: LibraryAcolyteConfront
The acolyte stares at you, then at the data-cube in your hand and the whimpering Dr. Vale. "You have awakened the Oracle and taken the sacred word," they intone, their voice trembling with anger. "The Choir will tear the skies apart to retrieve it."
[[Attempt to explain your purpose->LibraryAcolyteExplain]]
[[Flee before more guards arrive->LibraryEscape-Alone]]

:: LibraryCentralReason3
"What if the ash is a test?" you propose, "and Haven-0 is the answer? A world cleansed could be the true testament to your faith's endurance." The Priestess is silent for a long moment, her grip on her ceremonial blade loosening. "A test... we have only ever accepted the punishment."
[[Reach for the cube->LibraryCentralReasonTake]]

:: LibraryCentralReasonTake
You slowly, respectfully, pick up the data-cube from the altar. The Priestess does not stop you. Her acolytes watch, confused. "Go," she whispers. "Prove that choice still exists. If you fail, the ash will remain our truth." You have the fragment, granted by an unexpected truce.
[[Leave the Library under the Priestess's silent watch->LibraryEscape-Alone]]

:: LibraryEntrance-Alone
You step into the grand hall of the Sunken Library, clutching your wounded arm. Blood drips onto the stone floor. The corridors are silent, but you know your presence is marked. You must find the fragment quickly before your strength fails or more guards arrive.
[[Head toward the archives, following the rumors->LibraryArchives]]
[[Search the central chambers->LibraryCentral]]

:: LibraryInfiltrateNight-WithMoth
Under the cover of deep night, you and Moth move like ghosts toward the north wall. The Choir sentries are less vigilant, their lanterns creating small pools of light you easily avoid. You find the crack the Nomads described and slip inside unseen.
[[Enter the Library->LibraryEntrance-WithMoth]]

:: MarketAlleyConfront
You step out of the alley and confront the watching Legion soldier. "What do you want?" He smiles coldly. "Just keeping an eye on interesting newcomers. Captain Hale likes to know who's carrying valuable things." His hand rests on his sidearm.
[[Attack the soldier to silence him->MarketAlleyFight]]
[[Retreat back into the market crowd->OutpostMarket]]

:: MarketEscape
You shove a stall over to block the Legionaries' path and sprint for the outpost's main gate. Shots ring out. You duck and weave through the panicked crowd, bursting through the gate and out into the open wastes. You are free, but the Legion now knows your face and your prize.
[[Flee into the desert->WastelandTrail]]

:: MountainDistractionEntry-WithMoth
"Create a distraction down there," you whisper to Moth. She nods, picks up a large rock, and sends it clattering down the mountainside toward the Legion camp. As the guards turn to investigate the noise, you scramble across the ledge to the ventilation shaft.
[[Reach the shaft and attempt entry->MountainVentEntry-WithMoth]]

:: MountainLedgeAttack-WithMoth
You and Moth descend from the ledge, dropping into the midst of the Legion camp. Your attack is sudden and violent. You take down two soldiers before the alarm is raised. The camp erupts into chaos, giving you a chance to rush the main vault door.
[[Fight your way to the door->MountainDoorForce-WithMoth]]
[[Use the confusion to find another entrance->MountainVantage-WithMoth]]

:: MountainVentEntry-WithMoth
You and Moth pry the rusty grate from the ventilation shaft. It's a tight fit, but you squeeze inside. The shaft descends into the mountain, dark and dusty. It is your secret path into the vault, bypassing the Legion entirely.
[[Descend into the vault->GeoCoreVentEntry-WithMoth]]

:: OutpostSearchMore-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You search the outpost ruins more thoroughly, finding a cache of supplies and a hand-drawn map leading to the Zone's edge.
[[Take the supplies and head for the Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: PersonnelDoorHide
You drag the unconscious soldier's body behind a large boulder, concealing him from view. The door remains locked, but you have bought a little time. The patrol might not notice he's missing immediately.
[[Try to find another way to open the door->PersonnelDoorSearch]]
[[Retreat before a larger patrol arrives->MountainDescent]]

:: RidgeFoothillsShelter-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
[[Set out at first light->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: SaltFlatsNight-Alone
Night falls, transforming the salt flats into an eerie landscape of shadows and moonlight. The air grows cold. Traveling now is safer, hidden from the Choir's sight. You adjust your course toward the Forbidden Zone, guided by the stars and the pull of the fragments.
[[Travel by night->ForbiddenZoneEdge-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: TrailTalkCopeMoth
Moth smiles, a fragile thing in the bleak landscape. "The road is hard, but we walk it together. The Library holds answers, and maybe a friend." Her hope is a small light against the gloom. You travel with Moth.
[[Continue toward the Sunken Library->SaltFlatsEdge-WithMoth]]
:: UnionFacilityCutBonds
You slice through the bonds on Lyra's wrists with your knife. Freed, she immediately grabs a fallen soldier's weapon, and the two of you turn on the remaining Legionaries. The fight is now on even terms.
[[Fight your way to the exit->UnionFacilityEscape-WithLyra]]

:: UnionFacilityEscape-WithLyra
You and Lyra fight your way to a secondary exit, staggering out into the open wastes. The Legion facility is behind you, but you are both wounded and exhausted. The map fragment feels heavier than ever.
[[Put distance between you and the facility->WastelandTrail-WithLyra]]
:: UnionFacilityExit-WithLyra
You and Lyra leave the sterile corridors of the Union facility, emerging back into the harsh light of the wastes. The map fragment feels heavy now, its purpose clear and grim.
[[Journey toward the final fragment->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra]]
:: UnionFacilitySecure
Lyra slams her hand on a control panel, triggering a facility-wide lockdown. Bulkhead doors slam shut throughout the complex, sealing Captain Hale and his squad in a separate section. "That will hold them for a while," she says. "But this is their facility now. We need to leave."
[[Escape through the exit you originally used->UnionFacilityEscape-WithLyra]]

:: WastelandTrail-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
[[Head for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]
:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
Alone, you take a long, cautious path around the edge of the Forbidden Zone. It takes days, but you avoid the worst of the storms. You finally approach the vault from a relatively stable ridge, looking down at the entrance from above.
[[Descend to the vault entrance->ZoneVaultApproach-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultApproach-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
Alone, you pick your way down the ridge toward the dark opening of the Vault of Lament. Energy discharges light up the sky around you, and the ground trembles. The entrance seems to pulse with a malevolent energy. You have no skiff, no distraction—just your own determination.
[[Enter the vault alone->ZoneVaultEntry-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]

You steer the skiff into the dark mouth of the vault. The storm's fury is instantly muted, replaced by an echoing silence. The skiff glides to a halt in a vast, cavernous space. Strange, ancient machinery lines the walls, and at the far end, a final pedestal glows with a soft light.
[[Approach the final pedestal->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultFootApproach-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You and Moth abandon the faltering skiff and proceed on foot. The entrance looms, a gaping maw in the mountainside. You step inside, leaving the storm behind. The air is still and cold. Ahead, the cavern opens up, revealing the vault's heart.
[[Enter the main cavern->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultRear-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
The rear entrance is a small, fortified door. Moth uses a Nomad lock-picking tool to bypass the ancient mechanism. The door creaks open, revealing a dark maintenance tunnel that slopes downward into the heart of the vault. It is a safer, quieter entry point.
[[Enter the tunnel->ZoneVaultTunnel-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreVentEntry-WithMoth
The ventilation shaft is a tight, dusty crawl. Moth leads the way with a small glow-stick. "The Legion never found this," she whispers. The shaft opens onto a metal gantry high above the main cavern of the GeoCore Vault. Below, ancient machinery hums, and a crystal data-shard glows on a central pedestal.
[[Descend to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth]]
[[Follow the gantry to a control room->GeoCoreControlRoom-WithMoth]]

:: LibraryAcolyteExplain
"We seek to heal the world," you say, holding up the data-cube. "This is not theft. It is a desperate hope." The acolyte lowers their weapon slightly, confusion in their eyes. "The Choir believes the ash is the cure. You speak of healing... a concept we have forgotten."
[[Attempt to persuade the acolyte to let you pass->LibraryAcolytePersuade]]
[[Use their hesitation to escape->LibraryEscape-Alone]]

:: MarketAlleyFight
You lunge at the Legion soldier, catching him by surprise. The fight is brief and brutal in the confined alley. You subdue him quickly, but the sounds of struggle may have drawn attention. You need to leave the outpost immediately.
[[Drag the body into the shadows and find an exit->OutpostWalls]]
[[Flee the alley and run for the main gate->MarketEscape]]

:: MountainDoorForce-WithMoth
You and Moth press your shoulders against the massive vault door, trying to force it. It doesn't budge. The chaos of your attack on the Legion camp provides cover, but the door is sealed tight. You need another way in.
[[Search the camp for tools or explosives->MountainCampSearch-WithMoth]]
[[Retreat and look for the ventilation shaft->MountainVentEntry-WithMoth]]

:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
Alone, you trace a long, perilous path along the very edge of the Forbidden Zone. The energy storms flash to your left, a constant threat. After a grueling trek, you reach a vantage point overlooking the Vault of Lament. The entrance is a dark scar below.
[[Descend toward the vault->ZoneVaultApproach-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneStormEntry-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You step into the storm alone. The world vanishes in a screaming vortex. The map fragments feel like anchors pulling you down. You are blinded and thrown to the ground.
[[Succumb to the storm's fury->Ending-DeathByStorm]]
:: ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
The cavern is immense, filled with the deep thrum of dormant power. On a dais in the center, the fourth and final map fragment rests—a perfect crystal orb. Dr. Vale points a trembling finger. "The Catalyst Orb. Taking it will awaken the vault's defenses. We must be ready."
[[Take the final fragment->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
[[Search the cavern for a way to disable the defenses first->ZoneVaultSearch-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultEntry-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You enter the vault alone. The silence is absolute, broken only by the drip of water and the hum of your own fear. The cavern opens before you, vast and dark. The final fragment glows in the distance, a tiny beacon of hope in the overwhelming gloom.
[[Approach the fragment->ZoneVaultCavern-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultTunnel-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
The maintenance tunnel is cold and dark, sloping down into the mountain's heart. Moth's glow-stick casts long shadows. The tunnel ends at a heavy door. Peering through a grille, you see the main cavern and the glowing final fragment on its pedestal.
[[Open the door and enter the cavern->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
[[Look for a control panel to survey the area first->ZoneVaultTunnelControl-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth
You and Moth climb down to the cavern floor. The ancient machinery hums with a low, resonant frequency. In the center, a crystal data-shard pulses on a stone pedestal. A flickering hologram of an elderly man in a lab coat appears. "I am Dr. Oren Vale," the recording begins. "Haven-0 is our last hope, but it demands a final, terrible price."
[[Take the fragment->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithMoth-MetOren]]
[[Listen to the full message->ValeRecording-WithMoth]]

:: GeoCoreControlRoom-WithMoth
The gantry leads to a small control room filled with dusty consoles. Moth brushes off a screen, revealing a schematic of the vault. "I can trigger a lockdown from here," she whispers. "It would trap the Legion outside if they break in, but it might trap us too."
[[Initiate the lockdown->ControlRoomLockdown-WithMoth]]
[[Leave the controls and descend to the cavern->GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth]]

:: LibraryAcolytePersuade
The acolyte lowers their weapon, moved by your words.
[[Lead Dr. Vale to safety with Moth->LibraryEscape-WithMoth-MetOren]]
:: MountainCampSearch-WithMoth
You and Moth search the chaotic Legion camp amidst the fighting. You find a discarded satchel charge near the main door. "This might be enough to blow the lock," Moth says, hefting the explosive. But setting it will attract every soldier in the camp.
[[Place the charge on the door->MountainDoorBreach-WithMoth]]
[[Abandon the idea and seek another entrance->MountainVentEntry-WithMoth]]

:: ZoneVaultApproach-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
Alone, you stare into the chaotic heart of the Forbidden Zone. The three map fragments in your pack pull you toward a dark opening in a cliff face, the Vault of Lament. Energy arcs crackle across the sky, and the ground shudders. The final step is the most dangerous.
[[Enter the vault alone->ZoneVaultEntry-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
[[Search for a safer point of entry->ZoneCircuitousRoute-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultCavern-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
The cavern is vast and oppressively silent. Your footsteps echo. The fourth fragment, a crystal orb, glows on a central dais. A sense of immense, sleeping power fills the air. You are completely alone with the final key to Haven-0.
[[Take the final fragment->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
[[Search the perimeter for any security systems->ZoneVaultSearch-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren
You take the Catalyst Orb. The four fragments connect, forming a complete, glowing map that projects the location of Haven-0 into the air. A deep rumble shakes the cavern as ancient defenses awaken. "We have to go!" Moth shouts, grabbing Dr. Vale's arm.
[[Escape the vault->ZoneVaultEscape-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
[[Stand your ground against the defenses->ZoneVaultDefenses-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultSearch-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You and Moth search the cavern's edges, finding control panels crusted with age. Lyra interfaces her datapad with one. "The defenses are tied to the fragment's removal. There is no way to disable them. Taking it will trigger everything."
[[Accept the risk and take the fragment->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
[[Retreat and reconsider->ZoneVaultTunnel-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultTunnelControl-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You find a dusty control panel in the tunnel. Moth wipes it clean, revealing a small monitor. It shows a live feed of the main cavern. The final fragment glows on its pedestal. The room is empty, but the feed flickers with energy readings indicating active, hidden defenses.
[[Open the door and proceed->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
[[Stay in the tunnel and watch for patrols->ZoneVaultTunnelWatch-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ControlRoomLockdown-WithMoth
Moth inputs the command. A deep, resonant thud echoes through the mountain as the main vault door slams shut, sealing the Legion outside. The hum of the vault's machinery is now the only sound. "We're locked in," Moth says, her voice small in the vastness. "But so are our problems. Now we get the fragment."
[[Descend to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth]]

:: GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithMoth-MetOren
You take the crystal shard. The hologram of Dr. Vale fades.
[[Escape through the maintenance tunnel with Moth->GeoCoreEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren-Taken]]
:: MountainDoorBreach-WithMoth
You set the satchel charge on the door's locking mechanism. "Fire in the hole!" Moth yells, and you both dive for cover. The explosion tears through the camp's chaos, blowing the door off its hinges. The way into the vault is open, but the blast has drawn the attention of every Legion soldier.
[[Charge into the vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithMoth]]
[[Use the smoke and confusion to slip away->MountainVentEntry-WithMoth]]

:: ValeRecording-WithMoth
The hologram of Dr. Vale continues. "The energy required is catastrophic. Haven-0 will not survive the activation. To clear the sky, the facility must be destroyed. Anyone inside will be part of the sacrifice." Moth looks at you, her face pale. "A life for a life. The Nomad stories were true."
[[Take the fragment, accepting the cost->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithMoth-MetOren]]
[[Leave the fragment, horrified by the price->GeoCoreFragmentAbandoned]]

:: ZoneVaultDefenses-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren
The cavern rumbles. Panels in the walls slide open, revealing ancient robotic turrets that swivel toward you. Energy beams slice through the air. Moth pulls Dr. Vale behind a console. "We can't fight these! We have to run!" The escape route is already being cut off by crossing laser fire.
[[Make a desperate dash for the tunnel->ZoneVaultEscape-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
[[Try to use the fragment itself as a shield->ZoneVaultFragmentShield-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultEntry-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You step across the threshold into absolute darkness. The storm's fury is replaced by a silent, oppressive weight. Your three fragments glow faintly in your pack, their light barely piercing the gloom. The cavern ahead is a void, but a single, soft pulse of light beckons from its heart—the final fragment.
[[Approach the light->ZoneVaultCavern-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultEscape-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren
You grab Moth's arm and pull Dr. Vale along, sprinting for the maintenance tunnel as laser fire scorches the ground around you. You burst back into the tunnel, slamming the door shut behind you. The sounds of the defenses are muffled but persistent. You have the complete map, but the vault is now a death trap.
[[Flee the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneExit-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-HasAllFragments-MetOren
You reach out and take the crystal orb. The four fragments merge in your hands, casting a brilliant, detailed hologram of Haven-0's valley into the air. A deep, groaning shudder runs through the vault as ancient machinery awakens. You are alone with the power to save the world, and the certainty that it will cost you everything.
[[Leave the vault quickly->ZoneVaultEscape-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
[[Wait to see what the awakening brings->ZoneVaultAwakening-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultSearch-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You circle the cavern's perimeter, your senses alert. The place is eerily silent. You find no security panels, no automated defenses—only dust and the deep thrum of power emanating from the central dais. The fragment seems unguarded, but the silence feels like a trap waiting to be sprung.
[[Take the fragment->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
[[Retreat and observe longer->ZoneVaultObservation-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultTunnelWatch-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You and Moth wait in the tunnel, watching the monitor. The cavern remains empty, but the energy readings spike intermittently. After a long, tense minute, a patrol of two ancient robotic sentries clanks into view, circling the pedestal. They were invisible before. Taking the fragment will trigger an immediate response.
[[Wait for the sentries to pass->ZoneVaultTunnelWait-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]
[[Open the door and attack the sentries first->ZoneVaultTunnelAttack-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ForbiddenZoneExit-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren
You and Moth emerge with the complete map. Dr. Vale is not with you.
[[Begin the pilgrimage to Haven-0->Haven0Approach-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreConfrontation-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
The banging on the vault door intensifies. Captain Hale and his soldiers burst in.

[[Try to escape up the ventilation shaft with Moth->GeoCoreEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren-Confronted]]
:: GeoCoreEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You and Moth scramble up the maintenance tunnel to the mountainside. The Legion pursues.
[[Descend the mountain quickly->RidgeDescent-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithMoth
You charge through the blasted doorway into the GeoCore Vault. The corridor inside is stark metal, humming with power. Moth follows close behind. Ahead, the corridor opens into a vast cavern. In the center, a crystal shard pulses with light on a pedestal, and a hologram of an old man flickers beside it.
[[Approach the pedestal->GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth]]

:: ZoneVaultAwakening-HasAllFragments-MetOren
The holographic map of Haven-0 shines brightly in the dark cavern. The groaning sound deepens, and the walls begin to glow with soft blue lines of energy. A calm, automated voice echoes through the chamber: "Catalyst Orb authenticated. Haven-0 systems awakening. Proceed to primary control facility for final sequence initiation." The vault is not attacking; it is guiding you.
[[Leave the vault with the activated map->ZoneVaultEscape-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultCavern-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
[[Take the final fragment->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultEscape-HasAllFragments-MetOren
You hurry out of the Vault of Lament, the awakened energy of the place humming at your back. The complete map projects a clear path to Haven-0. The Forbidden Zone still crackles around you, but the map's glow seems to hold the storms at bay. Your destination is finally clear, but the final choice awaits.
[[Begin the final pilgrimage->Haven0Approach-HasAllFragments]]
:: ZoneVaultFragmentShield-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren
You hold up the combined map fragments, the brilliant hologram flaring as energy beams strike it. The beams deflect harmlessly, overloading the ancient turrets. "It's absorbing the energy!" Moth cries. The defenses power down momentarily, stunned by the feedback. You have a narrow window to escape.
[[Run for the exit->ZoneVaultEscape-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultObservation-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You wait, watching the dais from the shadows. The cavern remains still for a long time. Then, a faint shimmer in the air around the fragment reveals a projected energy field—a proximity shield. Walking into it would have triggered a lethal response. The shield flickers, revealing a brief pattern of weakness.
[[Time your approach to bypass the flickering shield->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultTunnelAttack-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You burst out of the tunnel door, taking the robotic sentries by surprise. Moth is swift, disabling one with a well-thrown knife to its joint. You tackle the other, smashing its optical sensor with the butt of your rifle. The way to the fragment is clear, but the noise may have alerted other systems.
[[Rush to the pedestal->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultTunnelWait-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You and Moth wait silently. The robotic sentries complete their patrol circuit and clank back into hidden alcoves in the walls, deactivating. The cavern is clear again, but only for a limited time before their next cycle.
[[Move quickly to the pedestal during the lull->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ConfrontationNegotiate-WithMoth
Captain Hale scoffs. "Cooperation is a luxury we cannot afford. My order is my salvation." He signals his soldiers to advance. Your attempt at peace has failed.
[[Prepare to fight alongside Moth->ConfrontationRefuse-WithMoth]]
[[Attempt to flee with Moth->GeoCoreEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren-Refused]]

[[Make a desperate break for the maintenance tunnel with Moth->GeoCoreEscape-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren-Refused]]
:: Haven0Approach-HasAllFragments
Alone, you stand at the edge of the secluded valley. Haven-0 is a gleaming arcology built into the far mountain, untouched by the ash. But the path is blocked. A Legion patrol secures the main road, Ashen Choir zealots chant at a makeshift altar, and Technic Union drones hover silently. They have all converged, and they know you have the completed map.

"I cannot be responsible for such destruction," you say, leaving the final fragment.
[[Leave the subway tunnel and return to the wastes->ForbiddenZoneExit-Abandoned]]
:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment2
You, Moth, and Dr. Vale stand at the edge of the churning landscape. The two map fragments hum insistently. Dr. Vale points a trembling finger. "The sorrow is the final key. We must carry it with us." The path ahead is a test of spirit.
[[Approach the vault entrance directly->ZoneVaultEntry-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment2]]
[[Search for a calmer path->ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment2]]
:: ValeHidingPlace-AnotherWay
"Is there no other way?" you ask, the weight of Vale's words pressing down. "A lock that requires sorrow... can it be bypassed? Forced?" Vale shakes his head slowly. "Force would trigger a cataclysm. Deception... the lock reads truth. There is only the true path, or no path at all. The alternative is to abandon the quest and let the world remain as it is."
[[Accept the necessity of sorrow and invite Vale to join you->ValeHidingPlace-Invite]]
[[Refuse the burden and leave the cave, abandoning the quest->Ending-AbandonedHope]]

:: Ending-AbandonedHope
You turn and walk away from the cave, abandoning the quest for Haven-0. The world remains ash-choked, a monument to choices unmade. You wander until your supplies run out, a solitary figure swallowed by the silent, gray expanse.
:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment2
Dr. Vale leads you and Moth on a long path around the Zone's edge. The journey is meditative, preparing you for the emotional trial ahead.

The maintenance tunnel slopes down into the vault.
[[Open the door to the cavern->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment2]]
:: Ending-LegionAmbush
The Legion soldiers swarm you. You fight bravely but are overcome by their numbers. Your journey ends here, on the mountainside, and Haven-0 falls to Captain Hale's control.

:: WastelandWandering
The wastes are endless and unforgiving. Your purpose lost, you become a ghost in the gray landscape, surviving day to day but no longer striving for a future.
[[Continue until the end->Ending-AbandonedHope]]

:: RidgeDescent-WithLyra-MetOren
You and Lyra descend the mountain quickly, the shouts of the Legion fading behind you. You abandoned the second fragment to escape. "We still have the first piece," Lyra says, trying to sound hopeful. "And we know where the others are. We can still complete the map." The path to the final fragment is long and dangerous.

You and Moth escape the Library with Dr. Vale.
[[Flee into the salt flats->SaltFlatsEscape-WithMoth-MetOren]]
:: UnionOutpost-WithLyra
You and Lyra arrive at the silent, dust-covered Union outpost. The domes are half-buried in ash, long abandoned. Lyra scans the area with her datapad. "No life signs. But there might be residual data in the archive terminal." Inside the main dome, you find a console that still has a flicker of power. Lyra interfaces with it. "The logs are corrupted, but I can extract a partial coordinate for the Vault of Lament. It's deep in the Forbidden Zone. We have a direction now."
[[Take the coordinate and head for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra]]
:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-MetOren
You and Lyra stand before the chaotic expanse of the Forbidden Zone. The air crackles with static. "We have one fragment and a name," Lyra says, her tech staff humming erratically. "Vale is the key. Finding him is more important than charging blindly into that." She points to a range of jagged mesas to the east. "The Whispering Rocks. Nomad rumors say a lonely light burns there at night."

[[Head for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithMoth-MetOren]]
:: SearchForVale-WithLyra
Lyra leads you east, into a region of strange, wind-carved mesas known as the Whispering Rocks. The air hums with a low, harmonic drone. After hours of searching, you find a small cave entrance hidden behind a curtain of viscous, black water. A faint glow emanates from within. "This feels like a place a broken man would hide," Lyra whispers.
[[Enter the cave cautiously->ValeHidingPlace-WithLyra]]

:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithMoth-MetOren
Moth leads you on a long, winding path around the perimeter of the Zone. It takes hours, but it avoids the worst of the visible energy storms. You finally approach the vault entrance from a ridge, where the ground is more stable. Below, the entrance to the Vault of Lament is a dark scar in the mountainside. The path down is steep but clear.
[[Descend toward the vault entrance->ZoneVaultApproach-WithMoth-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultApproach-WithMoth-MetOren
You, Moth, and Dr. Vale stand before the dark opening of the Vault of Lament. The air crackles with residual energy. Dr. Vale mutters, "Three keys... but the lock is sorrow. The door will not open without it." The two fragments in your pack pull insistently.
[[Enter the vault->ZoneVaultEntry-WithMoth-MetOren]]
[[Ask Dr. Vale to guide you through the emotional lock->ZoneVaultValeGuidance]]
:: ValeHidingPlace-WithLyra
The cave behind the black waterfall is small and damp. A lone figure huddles near a flickering heater, wrapped in a threadbare blanket. It is Dr. Oren Vale, frail and haunted. He looks up as you and Lyra enter, his eyes widening. Lyra steps forward slowly. "Dr. Vale? We're not with the Union. We have a map fragment. We need your help." Vale's gaze fixes on Lyra's tech-adorned staff, a flicker of recognition in his weary eyes. "Lyra Kade... the exile. You seek the ultimate answer. The final key is a burden of sorrow, not a piece of crystal."

[[Urge him to join you and face the final trial->ValeHidingPlace-Invite-WithLyra]]

:: ZoneShelterSearch-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
You and Lyra search the unstable perimeter of the Forbidden Zone, seeking any refuge from the raging storms. Lyra's scanner beeps erratically. "There! A signal... an old subsurface shelter." You find a half-collapsed entrance leading to a pre-Cataclysm bunker. Inside, the air is stale but breathable. The hum of the two map fragments is a constant reminder of the task waiting outside in the maelstrom.
[[Rest and plan your next move in the shelter->ZoneShelterRest-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]
[[Venture back out to continue the search for a safer path->ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]

:: ZoneStormEntry-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
You and Lyra step into the storm. The world dissolves into a screaming vortex of ash and energy. The two map fragments in your pack pull violently, like magnets. Lyra's tech fizzles and dies. Visibility is zero. The force of the storm throws you to the ground, tearing you apart from Lyra. You are alone in the chaos.
[[Be consumed by the storm->Ending-DeathByStorm]]

:: ZoneStormEntry-WithLyra-MetOren
With only the first fragment and Lyra by your side, you enter the Forbidden Zone. The storm is an immediate, physical wall of fury. The lone fragment's hum is drowned out by the howling wind. Lyra grabs your arm, shouting something lost to the gale. A brilliant energy arc lashes the ground nearby, and the shockwave throws you both into darkness.
[[Succumb to the storm's overwhelming power->Ending-DeathByStorm]]

[[Leave the cave->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-WithOren-HasMapFragment2]]
:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
Lyra consults her malfunctioning scanner, tracing a path along the very edge of the storm. "A direct route is suicide. But the energy patterns suggest a narrow corridor of relative calm here, if we're careful." The journey is agonizingly slow, a full day of skirting chasms of crackling light and fields of unstable, glassy ground. The two map fragments hum persistently in your pack. Finally, you reach a jagged ridge overlooking the Vault of Lament from a different angle. The entrance is a dark scar below, but the immediate approach seems less volatile.
[[Descend toward the vault from this new vantage->ZoneVaultApproach-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]

:: ZoneShelterRest-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
The old bunker offers a grim respite from the chaos outside. You and Lyra catch your breath in the dusty silence. The two map fragments on the floor between you glow faintly. "We're close," Lyra says, her voice echoing in the small space. "But two fragments might not be enough to pacify the vault's defenses. We need a plan, not just courage. Vale's knowledge is the missing piece." The shelter is temporary, but it provides a moment to think.

The cavern is vast and dark. The pedestal at the center is empty, the final fragment not yet manifested. Without the necessary emotional key, the vault remains dormant. Dr. Vale shakes his head sadly. "The lock is still closed. We need to find the true key, not just the pieces of the map."
[[Retreat and try a different approach->ForbiddenZoneExit-WithMoth-MetOren]]
[[Meditate on the loss of the world to unlock the door->ZoneVaultMeditation-WithMoth-MetOren]]
:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-WithOren-HasMapFragment2
You, Lyra, and Dr. Vale face the churning energy of the Forbidden Zone. The two fragments hum in unison. Dr. Vale steps forward. "The lock is not of metal. It is of memory. We carry the key within us." The direct path is a gauntlet.

[[Search for a calmer path->ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithLyra-WithOren-HasMapFragment2]]
:: ForbiddenZoneExit-WithMoth-MetOren
You emerge from the vault into the fringes of the Forbidden Zone. The two fragments remain inert, the final key elusive. Dr. Vale is despondent. "We must find another way. Perhaps the Sunken Library holds more clues, or we must simply carry more sorrow when we return."

:: ValeHidingPlace-Doubt
[[Head for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-MetOren-Doubted]]
:: ZoneVaultApproach-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
Alone with Lyra, you stare into the heart of the storm. The two map fragments hum insistently, pulling you toward the dark maw of the Vault of Lament. Lyra's face is set with determination. "Vale's theory or not, these fragments are a physical key. We have to try." The energy storms flash violently, and the ground trembles underfoot. The direct path is a gauntlet of visible danger.
[[Charge forward into the storm, trusting the fragments->ZoneStormEntry-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]

You enter the vault with Lyra and Dr. Vale.
[[Approach the central light->ZoneVaultCavern-WithLyra-WithOren-HasMapFragment2]]

[[Begin the pilgrimage to Haven-0->Haven0Approach-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]
:: RidgeDescent-MetOren
You descend the mountain alone, the second fragment abandoned. The encounter with Vale's hologram weighs on you. The path to the final fragment is now clear, but you must travel it without allies and without the second key.
[[Head for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-MetOren]]
[[Seek out the Technic Union for assistance->UnionOutpost-MetOren]]

:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-MetOren
You stand alone at the precipice of the Forbidden Zone, a landscape torn apart by raw energy and perpetual storm. The air crackles with static that raises the hairs on your arm. You abandoned the second fragment in the mountain vault, and the memory of Dr. Vale's holographic warning echoes in your mind. The map fragment you carry feels insufficient, its pull weak and uncertain against the zone's overwhelming chaos. The final key lies somewhere in that maelstrom, but the path is a suicide run for a lone traveler.
[[Enter the storm alone, trusting to fate->ZoneStormEntry-MetOren]]
[[Search for a longer, safer route along the unstable perimeter->ZoneCircuitousRoute-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
You and Lyra scramble up the maintenance tunnel to the mountainside, the second fragment secure. The Legion camp is still active below, but they haven't discovered this exit. "We have a head start," Lyra says, "but they'll be hunting us. We need to get off this mountain and decide our next move."
[[Descend the mountain carefully->RidgeDescent-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
:: SaltFlatsEdge-WithLyra
The salt flats are a blinding white expanse under the gloomy sky. Lyra shields her eyes. "The Sunken Library is out there, guarded by the Ashen Choir. They're fanatics, but they might hold a fragment. It's a different kind of danger than the Legion."
[[Approach the Library cautiously->LibraryApproach-WithLyra]]
[[Circle wide to scout for Choir patrols->SaltFlatsCircle-WithLyra]]
:: UnionOutpost-MetOren
The Union outpost is a cluster of half-buried domes, silent and dark. You enter cautiously, finding only dust and abandoned equipment. A light layer of ash covers every surface. In a spartan living quarter, you find a single note on a desk, written in a precise hand: "Gone to the Edge. The truth awaits. -O.V." The trail of Dr. Vale leads deeper into the wastes, to the most dangerous place of all.
[[Take the note and follow the clue to the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-MetOren]]
[[Search the outpost more thoroughly for useful gear->UnionOutpostSearch-MetOren]]

:: LibraryApproach-WithLyra
You and Lyra approach the low, dome-like structure of the Sunken Library. Ashen Choir sentries patrol with a rigid, fanatical dedication. Lyra assesses the situation. "A direct approach is asking for a fight. But my tech might let us sneak past their sensors."
[[Attempt to parley with the guards->LibraryParley-WithLyra]]
[[Look for a hidden weakness in the perimeter->LibraryInfiltrate-WithLyra]]
:: RidgeDescent-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
You and Lyra descend the mountain quickly, the shouts of the Legion fading behind you. The second map fragment is secure. "They'll be right behind us," Lyra gasps, checking the Legion datapad. "But we have a head start and their own intelligence. We need to get off this mountain and decide our next move." The path to the final fragment is long and fraught with danger.
[[Set a course for the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
:: RustRidgeFoothills-WithLyra
The mountains rise like the bones of the earth, sharp and forbidding. Lyra studies the peaks. "Skybreaker," she says, pointing to the tallest. "The GeoCore Vault is there. The Legion will be digging like ants. We need to be smarter than ants."
[[Ascend the mountain, seeking a hidden path->MountainAscent-WithLyra]]
[[Find a vantage point to observe the Legion's activity->MountainVantage-WithLyra]]
:: UnionOutpostSearch-MetOren
You search the silent, dusty Union outpost. In a locked storage locker, you find a durable enviro-suit and a cache of energy cells. Under a floor panel in the main living quarter, you discover a personal journal. The last entry reads: "The Choir knows I am here. I must go to the Edge, to the Vault. If the Wanderer finds this, tell them I am sorry. The price is higher than anyone knows." The equipment might aid your survival, but the journal's message is a grim warning.
[[Take the supplies and follow the clue to the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-MetOren]]
[[Leave the outpost, the warning heavy on your mind->WastelandTrail-MetOren]]

:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-MetOren
Alone, you trace a long, perilous path along the very edge of the Forbidden Zone. The energy storms flash to your left, a constant, threatening presence. The journey takes days, a grueling test of endurance as you skirt bottomless chasms and fields of unstable, glassy ground. Finally, you reach a jagged overlook. The Vault of Lament is a dark scar in the mountain below, its entrance seeming marginally calmer from this high, circuitous approach.
[[Descend carefully toward the vault->ZoneVaultApproach-MetOren]]

:: ZoneStormEntry-MetOren
You step into the storm alone. The world vanishes in a screaming vortex of ash and raw energy. The single map fragment in your pack hums weakly, its pull faint against the maelstrom's fury. Visibility is zero. The force of the gale throws you to the ground, and searing pain lances through your body as an energy arc discharges nearby.
[[Succumb to the storm's overwhelming power->Ending-DeathByStorm]]

:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
The Forbidden Zone churns before you, a nightmare vista of lightning and unstable geology. Lyra checks the Legion datapad, its screen flickering with corrupted data. "The logs mention the Vault of Lament, but the coordinates are scrambled by the storm's interference. Our two fragments pull us forward, but this place eats technology. We need to be very careful."
[[Press forward, trusting the pull of the fragments->ZoneStormEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
[[Search for a natural landmark mentioned in the datapad's partial logs->ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

You and Lyra approach the Sentinel under a flag of parley.
[[Try to persuade the Sentinel->LibraryPersuade-WithLyra]]
[[Use the distraction to infiltrate->LibraryParleyDistraction-WithLyra]]
:: MountainAscent-WithLyra
The climb up Skybreaker is steep and treacherous. Lyra uses her staff to test the stability of the loose shale. "The Legion will be using the main paths. We need to find the old service routes. The maps in my datapad suggest a trail along the eastern precipice, but it hasn't been maintained in decades."
[[Risk the eastern precipice trail->MountainPrecipiceTrail-WithLyra]]
[[Search for a different, safer ascent->MountainAscentSearch-WithLyra]]

:: MountainVantage-WithLyra
You and Lyra find a narrow ledge with a commanding view of the Legion's operation on the mountainside below. They have set up a full base camp around the main GeoCore Vault entrance. Lyra studies the scene through a monocular. "Their patrols are regular, but there's a gap near that rockfall to the west. It might be a way to get closer to the secondary entrance."
[[Plan an approach using the rockfall for cover->MountainRockfallApproach-WithLyra]]
[[Wait and watch for a shift change in the guards->MountainVantageWait-WithLyra]]

:: RidgeFoothillsShelter-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
You find a shallow cave in the foothills to rest. Lyra monitors the Legion datapad, its screen casting a pale light. "They're searching for us, but their signals are weak at this distance. We have a little time." The two map fragments glow softly in the dark, their combined light hinting at the path ahead into the Forbidden Zone.
[[Rest until dawn and then set out->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
[[Study the datapad's logs for more clues about the Vault of Lament->RidgeFoothillsStudy-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: WastelandTrail-MetOren
The wastes stretch out, silent and immense. You are alone, the encounter with Vale's journal a heavy memory. The path to the Forbidden Zone is long, and the warning about the price of Haven-0 lingers. The sky is a perpetual twilight, and the wind carries the taste of ash.
[[Press on toward the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-MetOren]]
[[Change course and seek out other survivors or factions->WastelandTrail-Detour-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultApproach-MetOren
Alone, you stand before the terrible majesty of the Vault of Lament. The entrance is a dark maw in a cliff face, wreathed in chains of lightning. The ground trembles with each energy discharge. The single map fragment in your pack hums with a persistent, lonely frequency, pulling you toward the darkness. The journey has led to this moment of solitary decision.
[[Enter the vault alone->ZoneVaultEntry-MetOren]]
[[Circle the entrance, looking for a safer point of entry->ZoneVaultCircle-MetOren]]

:: LibraryParleyDistraction-WithLyra
While Lyra argues, you slip away to the north wall entrance.
[[Infiltrate the Library->LibraryInfiltrate-WithLyra]]
:: MountainAscentSearch-WithLyra
You and Lyra circle the base of Skybreaker, searching for an alternative to the treacherous eastern trail. You find a narrow gully choked with debris, but it appears to wind upward at a gentler slope. Lyra scans it. "This might have been a water runoff channel. It's unstable, but it could get us above the Legion's main perimeter without being seen."
[[Risk the unstable gully->MountainGullyAscent-WithLyra]]

:: MountainPrecipiceTrail-WithLyra
The trail is a mere scratch on the cliff face, a dizzying drop to one side. You move with painstaking care, pressing against the rock. Lyra tests each foothold before committing. Halfway up, a section of the path crumbles under your boot, sending rocks cascading into the void. The sound echoes loudly. Below, a Legion patrol stops and looks up.
[[Freeze and hope you weren't seen->MountainPrecipiceHiding-WithLyra]]
[[Climb faster, abandoning stealth->MountainPrecipiceRush-WithLyra]]

:: MountainRockfallApproach-WithLyra
Using the large boulders of the recent rockfall as cover, you and Lyra move like shadows toward the secondary entrance. You are close enough to hear the bored conversation of the two guards stationed there. Lyra points to a ventilation grill near the ground, partially hidden behind a rock. "That might be a way in, if we can get to it quietly."
[[Attempt to silently neutralize the guards->MountainGuardTakeout-WithLyra]]
[[Create a diversion to draw the guards away from the grill->MountainRockfallDiversion-WithLyra]]

:: MountainVantageWait-WithLyra
You and Lyra wait on the narrow ledge, the cold seeping into your bones. Hours pass. Finally, the shift change occurs. The tired day guards trudge back to the camp, replaced by a fresh, more alert night watch. However, the new patrols are more numerous and overlap their routes, leaving no clear gap to exploit. The wait has cost you time and made the approach harder.
[[Abandon the vantage point and search for another route->MountainAscentSearch-WithLyra]]
[[Risk a swift, silent approach despite the tighter patrols->MountainNightApproach-WithLyra]]

:: RidgeFoothillsStudy-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
In the flickering light of the datapad, Lyra deciphes the corrupted Legion logs. "The Vault of Lament... Hale's scouts reported a 'psychic resonance' at the entrance. They couldn't breach it. Their equipment malfunctioned. The logs mention a 'sorrow-key' but dismiss it as superstition." This cryptic information matches what you learned from Vale's hologram. The path is clear, and strangely validated by enemy intelligence.
[[Set out for the Forbidden Zone at first light->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: WastelandTrail-Detour-MetOren
Seeking alternatives to the Forbidden Zone, you change course toward a range of jagged mesas. The air hums with a strange, low drone. You find signs of recent habitation—a cold fire pit, discarded ration tins—but no people. The detour leads you in a wide circle, costing you precious days. The map fragment's pull toward the Zone remains, a constant, nagging reminder of the task you are avoiding.
[[Finally turn toward the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-MetOren]]
[[Continue the futile search for another path->WastelandTrail-Detour2-MetOren]]

:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
Lyra uses the fragmented data from the Legion datapad to chart a course along the Zone's unstable edge. "The logs mention a 'serpent's pass'—a narrow, less volatile canyon." You find the entrance, a crack in the earth barely wide enough to walk through. The journey inside is claustrophobic, with the storm raging unseen above the canyon walls. It feels marginally safer, but the path is long and psychologically draining.
[[Follow the serpent's pass to its end->ZoneSerpentPassExit-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: ZoneStormEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
You and Lyra step into the storm. The world dissolves into a vortex of howling wind and lashing energy. The two map fragments pull violently. The Legion datapad in Lyra's hand sparks and dies instantly. A blinding flash throws you both to the ground. You lose sight of Lyra in the chaos, the storm's fury isolating you completely.
[[Be consumed by the maelstrom->Ending-DeathByStorm]]

:: ZoneVaultCircle-MetOren
Alone, you circle the vault entrance, looking for weakness. The lightning-wreathed archway is the only visible feature. The ground nearby is a treacherous mix of glassy slag and unstable rock. There is no rear entrance, no secondary door. The vault presents a single, formidable gate, guarded by the storm itself. Circling has only confirmed the grim reality: the only way in is through.
[[Accept the danger and enter through the main archway->ZoneVaultEntry-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultEntry-MetOren
You step across the threshold into absolute darkness and silence, the storm's fury cut off as if by a knife. The air is cold and still, heavy with age. Your solitary map fragment glows with a weak, lonely light, barely illuminating the rough-hewn walls of a short entrance tunnel. Ahead, the tunnel opens into impenetrable blackness. You are completely alone with the final mystery.
[[Venture into the main cavern->ZoneVaultCavern-MetOren]]

The central chamber is illuminated by glowing fungi. The altar is empty.
[[Move toward the archives->LibraryArchives-WithLyra]]
[[Search the altar for clues->LibraryCentralSearch-WithLyra]]
:: MountainGuardTakeout-WithLyra
You signal to Lyra. You take the left guard, she takes the right. You move with silent precision, emerging from behind the rocks. A swift, quiet struggle subdues both soldiers before they can raise an alarm. You drag the unconscious bodies out of sight. The path to the ventilation grill is clear.
[[Pry open the ventilation grill and enter->MountainVentEntry-WithLyra]]

:: MountainGullyAscent-WithLyra
The gully is steep and filled with loose rock. You and Lyra climb carefully, sending small slides of debris downward. The sound is muffled by the gully's walls. You ascend above the Legion's main perimeter unseen, reaching a ledge that overlooks the mountainside. The secondary personnel door is visible below, now lightly guarded.
[[Descend toward the personnel door from above->MountainLedgeDescent-WithLyra]]
[[Search for the ventilation shaft from this new vantage->MountainVantage-WithLyra]]

:: MountainNightApproach-WithLyra
Under the deep cover of night, you and Lyra move like shadows down from the ledge. The Legion night patrols are vigilant, but their lanterns create pools of light and shadow you expertly avoid. You reach the secondary personnel door without raising an alarm. The keypad glows faintly in the dark.
[[Have Lyra bypass the door lock->MountainDoorHack-WithLyra]]
[[Attempt to force the door manually->MountainDoorForce-WithLyra]]

:: MountainPrecipiceHiding-WithLyra
You press yourself against the cliff face, freezing in place. The Legion patrol below scans the mountainside. After a tense minute, they shrug and continue their round, assuming the falling rocks were natural. The danger has passed, but your nerves are frayed. The trail continues upward, more treacherous than ever.
[[Continue the ascent with extreme caution->MountainPrecipiceTrailContinue-WithLyra]]
[[Attempt to find a different route from this height->MountainPrecipiceAlternate-WithLyra]]

:: MountainPrecipiceRush-WithLyra
Abandoning stealth, you scramble upward as fast as you dare. The Legion patrol shouts and points. Shots ring out, bullets sparking off the rock near you. You and Lyra reach the top of the precipice trail and throw yourselves over the edge, landing on a wide ledge. You are safe for the moment, but the Legion knows your position.
[[Find cover on the ledge and plan your next move->MountainLedgeHide-WithLyra]]
[[Run for the nearest visible entrance->MountainRushEntry-WithLyra]]

:: MountainRockfallDiversion-WithLyra
Lyra finds a large, precariously balanced rock near the edge of the rockfall. She gives it a hard shove. It crashes down the slope, creating a loud rumble. The two guards at the secondary door turn to investigate the noise, moving away from their posts. You have a brief window to reach the ventilation grill unseen.
[[Dash to the grill and attempt entry->MountainVentEntry-WithLyra]]

:: WastelandTrail-Detour2-MetOren
The detour leads you through a region of skeletal trees and acidic ponds. You find no survivors, no safe havens. The map fragment's pull toward the Forbidden Zone is a constant, gravitational ache. Days are wasted. You are no closer to an alternative; you are only farther from your goal. The truth is inescapable.
[[Finally, reluctantly, turn your steps toward the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZoneEdge-MetOren]]

:: ZoneSerpentPassExit-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
The serpent's pass finally opens into a small, sheltered basin on the edge of the Forbidden Zone. The storm rages above the basin's rim, but the area itself is eerily calm. Ahead, the dark opening of the Vault of Lament is visible, its approach from this angle less violent. The Legion datapad is dead, but you have reached your goal.
[[Approach the vault entrance from the basin->ZoneVaultApproach-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultCavern-MetOren
The cavern is immense and utterly dark, save for the weak glow of your single map fragment. The air is cold and still. In the center, a dais holds a pedestal, but it is empty and dark. The vault is dormant, silent. Your fragment's hum is a lonely sound in the vast emptiness. The final key is not here; the lock requires more than you possess.
[[Retreat from the empty vault->ForbiddenZoneExit-MetOren]]

:: ForbiddenZoneExit-MetOren
You step back out of the silent vault into the chaotic fringe of the Forbidden Zone. The storm's fury feels like a welcome release after the oppressive stillness inside. Your single map fragment is inert, its purpose unfulfilled. The door remained shut, the final key beyond your reach. The journey has led to a dead end, and the path back is just as dangerous as the path forward.
[[Wander the wastes, seeking a new purpose or a forgotten clue->WastelandTrail-MetOren]]

:: LibraryArchivesEast-WithLyra
You and Lyra search the eastern stacks. The shelves are crammed with water-damaged botanical and geological texts from the old world. The air is thick with the smell of rotting paper. Lyra's scanner beeps weakly. "The signal is stronger here," she whispers. Behind a collapsed bookcase, you find a small, sealed container. Inside is not a data-cube, but a handwritten note on synth-parchment: "The key is not an object. It is a state of being. Seek the sorrowful heart. -O.V."
[[Take the note and search the western stacks->LibraryArchivesWest-WithLyra]]

[[Search the archives with Lyra->LibraryArchives-WithLyra-FromCurator]]
:: MountainDoorForce-WithLyra
You try to pry the personnel door open with a crowbar, but it is sealed tight. The metal groans loudly, echoing in the quiet night. A spotlight from the Legion camp below suddenly sweeps across your position. Shouts indicate you have been discovered. The stealthy approach has failed.
[[Retreat from the door and seek cover->MountainLedgeHide-WithLyra]]

:: MountainDoorHack-WithLyra
Lyra connects her datapad to the door's keypad. The screen flashes as she runs a decryption algorithm. After a tense minute, a light on the keypad turns green. The door slides open with a soft hiss, revealing a dark corridor leading into the mountain. The Legion patrols remain unaware.
[[Enter the vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithLyra]]

:: MountainLedgeDescent-WithLyra
From your high ledge, you and Lyra locate a series of narrow handholds leading down toward the personnel door. The descent is perilous, but you move slowly and silently. You reach a small platform just above the door, unseen by the guards below. The ventilation grill is directly beneath you.
[[Drop down to the grill and attempt entry->MountainVentEntry-WithLyra]]

:: MountainLedgeHide-WithLyra
You and Lyra press against the rock face on the wide ledge, hiding in a deep shadow. Legion searchlights sweep the area, but they do not find you. The soldiers eventually assume you have moved on, and their vigilance slackens. You are safe for now, but the main vault entrance is now heavily alerted to your presence.
[[Wait for the camp to settle and then attempt a new approach->MountainVantageWait-WithLyra]]
[[Risk a dash for a different entrance, like a ventilation shaft->MountainRushEntry-WithLyra]]

:: MountainPrecipiceAlternate-WithLyra
From your precarious position on the precipice trail, you spot a crack in the rock face leading sideways into the mountain. It might be a natural tunnel. It's a risky deviation, but it offers an alternative to the exposed trail.
[[Squeeze into the crack->MountainFissureEntry-WithLyra]]

:: MountainPrecipiceTrailContinue-WithLyra
You continue along the terrifyingly narrow trail, each step a calculated risk. The path winds upward until it finally reaches a stable, broad ledge high on the mountainside. From here, you have a clear view of the GeoCore Vault's main entrance far below, but no immediate way to descend to it. You need to find a route down.
[[Search the ledge for a way down->MountainLedgeDescent-WithLyra]]

:: MountainRushEntry-WithLyra
You spot a ventilation shaft opening a short sprint away from your ledge. With the Legion alerted, stealth is no longer an option. You and Lyra break from cover and run for the shaft. Bullets whiz past you as you reach the metal grate. Lyra blasts it open with a focused energy pulse from her staff, and you both drop into the darkness within.
[[Descend the ventilation shaft->GeoCoreVentEntry-WithLyra]]

:: MountainVentEntry-WithLyra
You pry open the ventilation grill and slip inside, Lyra following closely. The shaft is a tight, dusty metal tunnel that slopes downward into the heart of the mountain. The rumble of the vault's machinery grows louder as you descend. You have bypassed the Legion's perimeter entirely.
[[Follow the shaft to its end->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithLyra]]

:: ZoneVaultApproach-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
You and Lyra emerge from the serpent's pass into the sheltered basin. The Vault of Lament's entrance is a dark archway ahead.
[[Approach the vault entrance->ZoneVaultEntry-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithLyra
You step into a stark, metal-lined corridor, the hum of ancient machinery a constant drone. Lyra walks beside you, her staff casting a wary light. "This is a GeoCore primary artery," she whispers. "The main cavern should be ahead. Stay alert for automated defenses or Legion stragglers." The corridor slopes downward, the air growing cooler. A faint blue glow emanates from around the next bend.
[[Proceed cautiously toward the glow->GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreVentEntry-WithLyra
The ventilation shaft is a tight, vertical drop into darkness. You descend carefully, Lyra following close behind. The shaft levels out into a narrow maintenance tunnel, dusty and long-forgotten. The hum of the vault is louder here, vibrating through the metal walls. A grate ahead offers a view into a vast, illuminated space below—the main cavern of the GeoCore Vault.
[[Peer through the grate to scout the cavern->GeoCoreGantryScout-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryArchivesSearchVale
[[Take the data-cube->LibraryFragmentTaken-WithLyra-MetOren-Searched]]
:: LibraryFragmentTaken-WithLyra-MetOren
You take the data-cube from the strongbox. It pulses with a soft, blue light, the third map fragment. As you hold it, a shuffling sound comes from the shadows. An old man with a wild beard and tattered clothes emerges, his eyes wide. "You have it," Dr. Vale whispers. "The final key to the sorrow. But do you understand the lock?" Lyra steps forward, her voice gentle. "We're trying, Doctor. We need your help to understand."
[[Ask Vale to explain the nature of the Vault of Lament->ValeExplanation-WithLyra]]
[[Urge him to come with you to find the final fragment->ValeHidingPlace-Invite-WithLyra]]

:: MountainFissureEntry-WithLyra
You squeeze into the narrow crack in the rock face. It opens into a tight, twisting natural tunnel. Lyra follows, her staff providing the only light. The tunnel winds deep into the mountain, the air damp and cold. After a difficult crawl, you emerge onto a metal gantry high above a huge, humming cavern—the interior of the GeoCore Vault. The main entrance is far below, swarming with Legion activity, but you have entered unseen from above.

You and Lyra step through the dark archway into the Vault of Lament. The furious noise of the storm vanishes, replaced by an absolute, heavy silence. The two map fragments in your pack hum with a strong, clear frequency.
[[Approach the pulsating light->ZoneVaultCavern-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra
The metal corridor opens into a vast underground cavern, so large its ceiling is lost in darkness. Massive, dormant machinery lines the walls, their shapes skeletal in the faint blue light emanating from a central pedestal. On it rests a crystal data-shard, pulsing with a soft, rhythmic glow. A flickering hologram of an elderly man in a stained lab coat materializes beside it. "I am Dr. Oren Vale," the recording begins, its voice echoing in the immense space. "Haven-0 is not a myth. It is our last hope, and our final burden. Its activation requires a sacrifice that will echo through the ages."
[[Take the second map fragment->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithLyra-MetOren]]
[[Listen to the full message->ValeRecording-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreControlRoom-WithLyra
The gantry leads to a small control room overlooking the main cavern. Dust-covered consoles display flickering schematics of the vault's systems. Lyra brushes a screen clear, her fingers tracing a complex wiring diagram. "I can trigger a facility-wide lockdown from here," she whispers. "It would seal the main door, trapping the Legion outside when they break in. But it's a one-way command. It might seal us in with whatever defenses this place has."
[[Initiate the lockdown->ControlRoomLockdown-WithLyra]]
[[Leave the controls and descend to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreGantryScout-WithLyra
Peering through the grate, you see a breathtaking sight: a vast underground cavern far below, filled with the husks of colossal machines. A narrow metal gantry, upon which you are standing, circles the perimeter high above the floor. In the center of the cavern, a crystal shard glows on a stone pedestal, casting long shadows. The hologram of an old man flickers beside it. The main entrance on the far side is still sealed. For now, the cavern is silent and empty.
[[Descend the gantry stairs to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra]]
[[Follow the gantry to find a control room->GeoCoreControlRoom-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreTunnelExplore-WithLyra
You continue along the dusty maintenance tunnel, leaving the grate behind. The tunnel twists and turns, descending deeper into the mountain. The hum of the vault grows louder, a constant vibration in the metal floor. After several minutes, you reach a heavy, unlocked door marked "Level 3 Storage." Pushing it open, you find yourself in a small room filled with spare parts and old tools. Another door on the far side leads back toward the main cavern corridors.
[[Enter the storage room and search for useful items->GeoCoreStorage-WithLyra]]
[[Return to the grate and descend to the gantry->GeoCoreGantryScout-WithLyra]]

:: ZoneVaultCavern-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
The cavern is a cathedral of black rock, vast and silent. The air is cold and perfectly still, a stark contrast to the maelstrom outside. In the very center, a stone dais supports the final fragment: a perfect crystal orb that pulses with a gentle, inviting light. The two map fragments in your pack hum in harmonious resonance with the orb. Dr. Vale's holographic warning echoes in your memory, but the vault itself feels peaceful, as if waiting.
[[Take the Catalyst Orb->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-HasAllFragments]]
[[Search the cavern's perimeter for any hidden dangers->ZoneVaultCavernSearch-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: ControlRoomLockdown-WithLyra
Lyra inputs the command. A deep, resonant thud echoes through the mountain as the massive main vault door slams shut and locks. The hum of the vault's machinery is now the only sound. "We're locked in," Lyra says, her voice echoing in the control room. "But so is the Legion. They won't be bothering us now. Let's get the fragment."
[[Descend to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithLyra-MetOren
You take the crystal shard. It connects with your burned fragment, the two pieces locking together with a soft click. A more detailed section of the route to Haven-0 is revealed. The hologram of Dr. Vale flickers and fades. "Two pieces," Lyra murmurs. "We're halfway there." The cavern remains silent, the Legion sealed outside by the lockdown. Your only exit is the way you came in.
[[Return to the ventilation shaft to escape->GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreStorage-WithLyra
The storage room is a clutter of rusted parts and discarded tools. Lyra pokes through a crate, finding a few usable energy cells and a heavy-duty flashlight. "Nothing directly related to the map," she says, "but these might come in handy." The room offers no other exits except the door you entered and the one leading toward the main corridors.
[[Take the useful items and return to the maintenance tunnel->GeoCoreGantryScout-WithLyra]]

:: ValeRecording-WithLyra
The hologram of Dr. Vale continues, its voice grave. "The energy required to activate Haven-0's purifier is catastrophic. The facility's core cannot contain the reaction. It was designed as a single-use event. To clear the sky, Haven-0 must be destroyed. Anyone inside when the sequence is initiated will be part of the sacrifice. Remember this." The recording loops, the warning hanging in the air.
[[Take the fragment, accepting the terrible cost->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultCavernSearch-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren
You and Lyra circle the perimeter of the vast cavern, your footsteps echoing in the absolute silence. The walls are smooth, black rock, featureless except for a few faded, painted symbols that might be warnings or instructions. Lyra scans them with her dead datapad, but it offers no translation. The cavern is empty save for the central dais. There are no hidden panels, no robotic sentries, no visible threats. The only thing that matters is the orb.

:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra
The edge of the Forbidden Zone is a jagged tear in the world. You stand with Lyra, the map fragment in your pack a quiet weight. Lyra scans the horizon. "The Sunken Library is out there, but so is the Ashen Choir. The fragment pulls westward, but the data is unclear. We can seek the Library or press on toward the mountains."

:: Ending-LegionExecution-WithMoth
The Legion soldiers are too many, too disciplined. You and Moth fight valiantly, back-to-back in the echoing cavern, but you are surrounded and outgunned. A stray shot catches Moth in the shoulder, and she stumbles. You are overwhelmed moments later. Captain Hale kneels to retrieve the map fragments from your grasp. "A shame. The Nomad showed spirit," he says coldly. "But order requires sacrifice." Haven-0 falls under Legion control, and the world is remade by iron rule.

:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
The edge of the Forbidden Zone is a jagged tear in the world, a landscape of churning energy storms and perpetual twilight. You stand with Lyra, the two map fragments in your pack humming in unison, their pull leading you into the heart of the chaos. Lyra checks her scanner, its readings flickering erratically. "The interference is intense. Our best chance is to find a moment of calm or a natural landmark that the fragments recognize. Charging in blind is a death sentence."

:: ZoneStormEntry-WithMoth
You step into the storm, the two map fragments pulling you forward. The world dissolves into a howling chaos of wind and lashing energy. Moth shouts something lost to the gale, her form a blur beside you. The sand-skiff's instruments fail instantly. A violent tremor throws you both from the skiff, and you land hard on the shaking ground. The storm's fury is a physical wall, isolating you in a maelstrom of ash and lightning.

The edge of the Forbidden Zone is a raging wound in the earth. You stand with Lyra, the two map fragments humming in your pack. The data scavenged from the Union outpost gives you a precise heading through the worst of the visible storm patterns. "There," Lyra says, pointing to a corridor of relative calm in the chaos. "The datapad's models suggest we have a twelve-minute window before the energy fields reconfigure. We need to move fast and hope the data is still accurate." The path is a calculated risk, a sliver of order in the madness.

You and Moth approach the assembled factions with hands raised, the completed map glowing brightly in your hand. "This doesn't have to end in bloodshed!" you call out. Captain Hale scoffs. "The Legion brings order." A Choir priest shrieks about blasphemy. A Union envoy states coldly, "The facility requires scientific control." Moth tries to appeal to their common desire for survival, but the factions' ideologies are too rigid. The parley dissolves into shouted accusations and threats.
[[The tensions explode into open conflict->Haven0Battle-WithMoth]]

You and Lyra plunge into the corridor of relative calm predicted by the Union data. The path is a narrow canyon, its walls shimmering with contained energy. The two map fragments hum strongly, their light seeming to reinforce the temporary stability. Lyra checks a timer on her datapad. "Ten minutes. We need to move." The canyon winds deep into the heart of the Zone, the storm raging silently overhead, held at bay by some unseen force.

The cavern is a cathedral of black rock, vast and silent. The air is cold and perfectly still, a stark contrast to the maelstrom outside. In the very center, a stone dais supports a pedestal, but it is empty and dark. The two map fragments in your pack hum with a persistent, questioning frequency. Dr. Vale's holographic warning echoes in your memory. The vault is dormant, waiting for a key you do not yet possess. The final fragment is not here. The sorrow-key remains elusive.

[[Wander the edge of the Zone->WastelandTrail-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2]]
:: ZoneVaultCavernSearch-WithLyra-HasMapFragment2
You and Lyra comb the perimeter of the vast, silent cavern. The smooth black walls offer no seams, no hidden panels. In a shadowed alcove, you find a series of faint carvings: a weeping figure holding a broken circle, a sky raining fire, and a single door marked with a teardrop. Lyra traces the symbols. "It's not a technical schematic. It's a story. The lock responds to grief. The sorrow of the Cataclysm itself." The empty pedestal at the center seems to confirm it. The final fragment is not a physical object you can take; it is a key that must be forged from memory and loss.

You sit before the carvings, closing your eyes. Lyra stands watch, her presence a quiet support. You push past the immediate struggles for survival—the Legion, the storms, the thirst. You remember the world before the ash, seen only in faded pictures. The cities full of light, the green fields, the faces of billions now lost. A profound, silent grief, not just for what you lost, but for what the entire world lost, wells up inside you. It is a sorrow vast enough to fill this cavern. The two map fragments in your pack begin to glow brighter, their light pulsing in time with your heartbeat. A low hum fills the air, and a soft light blossoms on the previously empty central pedestal. The final key has manifested.

Alone, you step into the heart of the Forbidden Zone. The two map fragments in your pack pull violently, their hum a desperate counterpoint to the storm's roar. The air crackles with raw energy, and visibility drops to zero. A searing flash of lightning illuminates the churning ground for an instant, revealing a landscape of shattered rock and glassy slag. The force of the gale throws you to your knees. Dr. Vale's warning about the sorrow-key echoes in your mind, a hopeless thought against the overwhelming physical fury surrounding you.
[[Succumb to the maelstrom->Ending-DeathByStorm]]

You, Moth, and Dr. Vale sit in the vast, silent cavern. The air is heavy with unspoken sorrow. The three map fragments in your pack glow softly. Guided by Vale's quiet murmurs about grief and Moth's supportive presence, you close your eyes and let the memories come. You remember the world before the ash, the faces lost, the silent enormity of the Cataclysm. A profound sorrow, shared and acknowledged by your companions, fills the space.

:: ZoneStormEntry-WithMoth-MetOren
You and Moth step forward into the howling fury of the Forbidden Zone, Dr. Vale a frail figure between you. The two map fragments in your pack pull insistently, their hum a fragile thread against the storm's roar. A violent gust of wind tears Moth's grip from your arm, and a blinding flash of energy arcs across the ground, separating you from Dr. Vale. In an instant, the storm isolates each of you in a maelstrom of ash and screaming wind. The world dissolves into chaos.
[[Be consumed by the maelstrom->Ending-DeathByStorm]]

:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-HasDatapad-MetOren

:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-HasDatapad-MetOren
The single map fragment provides a weak pull, a lonely guide as you trace a long, treacherous path along the storm's edge. The Legion datapad is dead weight now, its screen cracked and dark. The journey takes days, a solitary slog across glassy, unstable ground. You finally reach a high ridge overlooking the Vault of Lament. The entrance is a dark scar far below, wreathed in flickering energy. The circuitous route has avoided the worst of the storms, but the final descent is a sheer drop into uncertainty.
[[Descend toward the vault entrance->ZoneVaultApproach-MetOren]]

:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
Moth leads you on a long, winding path around the perimeter of the Forbidden Zone. The two fragments hum in your pack, a constant duet against the distant storm's roar. She points out unstable ground and hidden crevasses, her Nomad knowledge a lifeline. After a grueling day's trek, you reach a high vantage point. Below, the Vault of Lament's entrance sits in a relatively calm basin, the path down a steep but manageable slope.
[[Descend into the basin toward the vault->ZoneVaultApproach-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]

:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
Dr. Vale sets a slow, deliberate pace, leading you and Moth on a long arc around the Zone's chaotic heart. The three map fragments create a harmonious thrum, their combined light seeming to soothe the turbulent energy fields. "The direct path is for despair," Vale mutters. "The long path is for contemplation." The journey is peaceful, almost meditative. You finally approach the vault from a high, serene overlook, the entrance a dark but calm opening below.
[[Descend the peaceful path to the vault entrance->ZoneVaultApproach-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: ZoneStormEntry-HasDatapad-MetOren
You step into the maelstrom alone, the Legion datapad a useless lump in your pack. The single map fragment's hum is instantly drowned by the storm's deafening roar. A violent gust throws you to the ground. The datapad flies from your grasp, smashing against a jagged rock. You are blind, deafened, and alone in the heart of the chaos, the fragment's weak pull your only tether to a world that is dissolving around you.

The storm rages at the basin's rim, a distant curtain of light and sound, but the immediate area is eerily calm. Moth looks at the entrance, then at you. "It's waiting," she whispers. The path forward is clear and ominous.
[[Enter the vault->ZoneVaultEntry-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
The cavern is a vast, silent space, the air thick with ancient stillness. The three map fragments in your pack glow brightly, casting long shadows. In the center, the final pedestal is empty. Dr. Vale steps forward, his voice a raspy whisper. "Three physical keys... but the lock remains closed. The sorrow-key must be present. The heart must be open." The vault acknowledges the fragments but awaits the true catalyst.

The air is cold and still, and the cavern ahead is a vast expanse of darkness broken only by the faint glow of your fragments. Moth looks around, her usual optimism tempered by the oppressive atmosphere. "It's like the mountain is holding its breath," she whispers. A single, soft pulse of light beckons from the center of the cavern, but the pedestal there remains shrouded in shadow.

The three map fragments in your pack unleash a powerful, concerted hum, their combined light forming a faint shield against the worst of the ash and energy. Moth steers the sand-skiff with desperate skill, reading the winds that the fragments seem to calm. Dr. Vale clutches the gunwale, his eyes wide but clear. "The sorrow is the key! Hold it fast!" A colossal energy arc slams into the ground ahead, and the skief fishtails violently, but the fragment's shield holds, allowing you to plunge through the dissipating energy into a momentarily calm eye of the storm.

You take the second map fragment. It fits with the first, revealing more of the route to Haven-0. The hologram of Dr. Vale fades. The main vault door remains sealed. You and Lyra are alone in the silent cavern.
[[Exit through the maintenance tunnel->GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: Haven0Core-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments-Infiltrated
You, Lyra, and Dr. Vale move silently through the maintenance conduits, emerging into the vast core chamber of Haven-0. The central control terminal glows softly. The final choice is yours.

You step into the vault with Moth and Dr. Vale, guided by the shared sorrow you've cultivated. The two fragments hum with a clear, purposeful frequency. The oppressive silence feels less hostile. A soft, welcoming light pulses from the center of the cavern. The final trial awaits.
[[Approach the awakening light->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-MetOren-Guided]]
:: ZoneVaultEntry-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment3-MetOren
You, Moth, and Dr. Vale cross the threshold into the Vault of Lament. The three map fragments in your pack create a harmonious, resonant hum that seems to calm the very air. The oppressive silence of the vault feels less hostile, more expectant. Dr. Vale walks forward with a quiet confidence. "Three physical keys," he murmurs, "and now, the heart must provide the fourth." The central cavern opens before you, the pedestal waiting in the gloom. The journey has converged on this moment of synthesis.
[[Enter the main cavern to face the final trial->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment3-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreCavern-WithLyra-HasDatapad-LockedIn
The air is stale, the main entrance sealed by your lockdown command. The hologram of Dr. Vale flickers beside the glowing second map fragment on its pedestal. Lyra looks at you, her expression grim. "We're locked in, but the fragment is ours. Our only way out is the same way we came in." The hum of the vault's machinery is now the only sound.

[[Take the second map fragment->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-LockedIn]]
[[Listen to the full message from the hologram->ValeRecording-WithLyra-HasDatapad-LockedIn]]
:: Haven0Infiltrate
Alone, you use the chaotic terrain of the valley to your advantage. You slip behind rock formations and slide into drainage ditches, moving like a shadow around the perimeter of the faction standoff. The Legion is focused on the Choir, the Choir on their chants, and the Union on observing both. You find a collapsed section of the arcology's outer shield wall, hidden by overgrown brambles. Squeezing through the gap, you enter a dark, dusty maintenance corridor within Haven-0 itself. The sounds of the outside world are muffled. You are inside, undetected.
[[Follow the corridor toward the facility's heart->Haven0Core-Alone]]

:: ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment2
The cavern is immense and silent. The two fragments hum. The central pedestal is empty. Dr. Vale confirms the lock is emotional.
[[Meditate to manifest the final key->ZoneVaultMeditation-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment2-MetOren]]
:: ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-HasMapFragment2-MetOren-HasAllFragments
You reach out and take the Catalyst Orb that manifested from your shared meditation. The two physical fragments and the newly formed third connect, creating a complete, glowing map. The vault shudders, not with hostility, but with a sense of release. A path out of the cavern reveals itself, a previously hidden door sliding open. Moth looks at you with awe. "You did it. You found the key inside." Dr. Vale nods solemnly. "The road to Haven-0 is open. The final choice awaits."

:: Haven0Core-Alone
You stand in the immense core chamber of Haven-0 alone. The central terminal is a complex array of screens and interfaces, all dormant. The silence is absolute. The completed map in your hand projects the activation sequence, but Dr. Vale's warning echoes in the emptiness. To clear the sky, you must destroy this marvel and likely yourself with it. There is no one to consult, no one to share the burden. The final choice is yours, and yours alone.

:: ZoneVaultMeditation-WithMoth-WithOren-HasMapFragment2-MetOren
You, Moth, and Dr. Vale sit in the vast, silent cavern. The two map fragments in your pack glow softly. Guided by Vale's quiet murmurs and Moth's supportive presence, you close your eyes and let the memories come. You remember the world before the ash, the faces lost, the silent enormity of the Cataclysm. A profound sorrow, shared and acknowledged by your companions, fills the space. The air hums, and a soft light blossoms on the previously empty pedestal—the Catalyst Orb, formed from shared remembrance.
[[Take the final fragment->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithOren-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]

:: Haven0Approach-WithMoth-WithOren-HasAllFragments-MetOren
You, Moth, and Dr. Vale stand on a high ridge, looking down into the secluded valley where Haven-0 lies. The arcology is a marvel of preserved pre-Cataclysm engineering, its surfaces gleaming despite the ash-choked sky. Below, the factions have converged at the main entrance: a Legion patrol secures the road, Ashen Choir zealots chant at a makeshift altar, and Technic Union drones hover watchfully. They have all found the legendary facility, and they know you possess the completed map. Moth grips your arm. "They're all here. A direct approach is a death sentence." Dr. Vale looks pale but resolute. "The final choice cannot be made by them. It must be ours."

[[Approach the awakening light and take the Catalyst Orb->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-LockedIn
You take the second map fragment. It fits with the first, revealing more of the route to Haven-0. The hologram of Dr. Vale fades. The air in the cavern is stale, the main vault door sealed tight by your own lockdown command. Your only exit is the maintenance tunnel. "We have what we came for," Lyra says, her voice echoing softly in the confined space. "But we've locked ourselves in with it. Our way out is the same way we came in."

[[Escape through the ventilation shaft->GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-LockedIn]]
:: Haven0Assault
You shout a challenge and charge down the slope directly toward the main entrance of Haven-0. The sudden, solitary rush catches the assembled factions by surprise. Legion soldiers scramble to aim their rifles, Choir zealots break their chant to draw weapons, and Union drones swivel in the air. Bullets whiz past you, and energy beams scorch the ground at your feet. It is a desperate, suicidal dash through the heart of the converging enemy forces, a gamble on speed and sheer audacity.
[[Reach the massive entrance doors->Haven0Entrance-Alone]]

:: Haven0Assault-WithMoth-WithOren

:: Haven0Battle
The valley erupts into a storm of violence. Legion troops fire on Choir zealots, who charge with fanatical fury. Union drones unleash beams of energy, targeting everyone indiscriminately. You are caught in the center, a lone figure trying to survive the crossfire. A Legion sniper's shot rings out, and a searing pain tears through your leg. You stumble, falling behind cover as the factions close in, their conflict consuming the hope of a peaceful resolution.

You and Lyra scramble back up the narrow maintenance tunnel, the silent, sealed vault falling away below. You emerge onto the windy mountainside, the second fragment secure. The lockdown has trapped the Legion outside. "They'll be waiting for us," Lyra says. "Our only advantage is they don't know about this exit. We need to disappear fast."
[[Descend the mountain carefully->RidgeDescent-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]
:: Haven0Entrance-Alone
You throw your shoulder against the massive, ornate door of Haven-0, and it slides open just enough for you to slip through. It booms shut behind you, cutting off the sounds of the raging battle outside. You are alone in an immense, pristine atrium. The air is clean and cool, a shocking contrast to the ash-choked world you just left. A wide, sweeping corridor descends into the heart of the arcology, illuminated by soft, ambient light. The completed map in your hand pulses, pointing the way forward. The final choice, and its terrible price, awaits you in the silence.
[[Proceed down the main corridor toward the control center->Haven0Core-Alone]]

:: Haven0Core-WithMoth-HasAllFragments
The core chamber is vast, a cathedral of technology humming with dormant power. You and Moth stand before the central control terminal, a complex array of screens and interfaces. The completed map in your hand projects the final activation sequence. Dr. Vale's warning echoes in your memory. "The energy required will consume this facility. Anyone inside will be part of the sacrifice." Moth meets your gaze, her expression serious. "The choice is yours."

You squeeze through the gap, emerging into a dark, dusty utility corridor within Haven-0. The sounds of the battle outside are muffled. You are inside, undetected, with your companions.
[[Follow the corridor toward the facility's heart->Haven0Core-WithMoth-WithOren-HasAllFragments-MetOren]]
:: Haven0Entrance-WithMoth-WithOren-HasAllFragments-MetOren
The massive, sculpted door of Haven-0 slides shut with a resonant boom, cutting off the sounds of the fierce battle outside. You, Moth, and Dr. Vale stand panting in the sudden, absolute silence of a vast reception hall. The air is startlingly pure and cool. Moth brushes ash from her clothes, her eyes wide as she takes in the scale of the preserved pre-Cataclysm architecture. "It's... quiet," she says, her voice a hushed reverence. Dr. Vale stumbles forward, running a hand over a smooth, unblemished wall. "The environmental systems are still active. The heart of the facility is this way." He points down a broad, descending corridor that seems to swallow the light. The map fragments in your pack have fallen silent, their purpose fulfilled in guiding you here. Now, only the choice remains.

You, Moth, and Dr. Vale shout a unified cry and charge down the slope directly toward the main entrance. The sudden, bold assault shocks the assembled factions. Legion troops fire, Choir zealots charge with blades, and Union drones unleash energy beams. Moth moves with acrobatic grace, dodging and weaving, her presence a shield for the frail Dr. Vale. You provide covering fire, creating a path through the crossfire. It is a frantic, high-stakes race against overwhelming opposition.

You step forward into the open space, Moth and Dr. Vale flanking you. The completed map glows brightly in your hand. "We don't have to fight! Haven-0 can be a new beginning for all!" Moth adds her voice, speaking of the Nomads' dream of a free sky. Dr. Vale explains the terrible, necessary cost of activation. Captain Hale dismisses the risk as a lack of discipline. A Choir High Priestess condemns the endeavor as heresy. A Union scientist insists on cold, logical control. The factions' fundamental beliefs prove irreconcilable. Negotiations crumble instantly, and the valley descends into violent conflict.

You and Moth stand at the edge of the churning nightmare that is the Forbidden Zone. The air crackles with violent energy, and the ground trembles underfoot. Dr. Vale is with you, his frail form seeming to waver in the unstable air. He points a trembling finger toward the heart of the maelstrom. "The sorrow-key is not out there," he murmurs, his voice barely audible over the storm's roar. "It is in here." He taps his chest. "We must carry it with us." Moth looks at you, her usual optimism replaced by a grim determination. "The Nomads say the door reads the heart. We must be ready."

After wandering the wastes and speaking with Dr. Vale, you return to the edge of the Forbidden Zone with a new understanding. The two map fragments in your pack hum with a different quality, no longer just a pull toward a place, but a resonance with the memory you carry. Moth stands beside you, her faith unwavering. "The door will open for a truthful heart," she says. Dr. Vale nods, his eyes clear for the first time. "The sorrow is the key. Not despair, but acknowledgement. We are ready." The storm seems less intimidating now, its fury a reflection of the world's pain that you now carry with purpose.

The air is unnervingly clean, cooler than the wastes, carrying a faint ozone scent. Lyra immediately scans the vast, gleaming atrium with her tech-staff, its tip casting a soft blue light on pristine white walls. Dr. Vale leans against the door, catching his breath, his eyes wide with a mix of awe and terror. "I never thought I would see this place with my own eyes again," he whispers. Ahead, a wide, gently sloping corridor descends into the heart of the arcology, illuminated by soft, ambient strips of light. The completed map in your hand pulses gently, its projection now a clear arrow pointing down that corridor. The final threshold is crossed; the ultimate choice lies ahead.

Using the distraction of the faction confrontation, you, Moth, and Dr. Vale skirt the edge of the valley, hidden by rock formations. Moth leads you to a fissure masked by ancient, brittle salt formations. "A forgotten way in," she says. Dr. Vale nods grimly. "A service access from the construction era." You crawl through the tight opening into a cold, dark maintenance tunnel within the arcology's foundations. The air is stale but breathable. The roar of the battle is a distant rumble. Moth lights a glow-stick, illuminating the way forward. You are inside Haven-0, unseen by the warring factions outside.
[[Follow the maintenance tunnel toward the core->Haven0Core-WithMoth-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]

[[Take the fragment, accepting the cost->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-Retreat
You and Lyra fight a rearguard action as you retreat up the maintenance tunnel. Legion fire ricochets around you. You scramble into the shaft just as soldiers burst into the cavern below. You have the fragment, but the Legion is in hot pursuit.
[[Escape the mountain->RidgeDescent-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreEscape-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-Grabbed
You and Lyra dash up the maintenance tunnel, the sound of Legion pursuit close behind. You emerge onto the mountainside, the fragment safely in your possession. "No time to admire the view," Lyra gasps. "We need to get down from here now!"
[[Descend the mountain quickly->RidgeDescent-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren]]

:: TowerRuinTalk-Join
[[Travel with Lyra->WastelandTrail-WithLyra-JoinedAtTower]]
:: TowerRuinTalk-Leave
"I work better alone," you say. Lyra's smile fades, replaced by a look of respect. "The road is jealous. Good luck, Wanderer." She turns and walks away, soon a lone figure swallowed by the vastness of the waste.
[[Continue your journey alone->WastelandTrail]]

:: SaltFlatsCircle-WithLyra
You and Lyra circle wide, using the salt formations as cover. You see a group of gray-robed zealots approaching a stalled Nomad skiff from the opposite direction. Lyra points. "That's Moth's skiff. The Choir doesn't look friendly."
[[Rush to warn Moth->SkiffWarning-WithLyra]]

[[Change course toward the Rust-Ridge mountains->RustRidgeFoothills-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
:: SaltFlatsSneak-WithLyra
While the Choir zealots approach Moth's skiff, you and Lyra use the salt pillars as cover to slip past unnoticed. Your path toward the Sunken Library is clear, but you have left Moth to face the fanatics alone. The decision weighs on you as you move silently across the crystalline plain. Lyra glances back once, her expression unreadable, before focusing on the dark dome ahead.
[[Reach the Library alone with Lyra->LibraryApproach-WithLyra]]

:: ValeRecording-WithLyra-HasDatapad-LockedIn
The hologram of Dr. Vale continues, its tone grave. "The energy required is catastrophic. Haven-0's core cannot contain the reaction. It was designed as a single-use event. To clear the sky, Haven-0 must be destroyed. Anyone inside when the sequence is initiated will be part of the sacrifice." The warning hangs in the silent, trapped cavern. Lyra looks from the fragment to your face, the grim reality settling in. The main vault door remains sealed by the lockdown.

[[Take the fragment, accepting the terrible cost->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithLyra-HasDatapad-MetOren-LockedIn]]
:: LibraryApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra
You, Moth, and Lyra stand together before the low, dome-like structure of the Sunken Library. The air is heavy with the smell of salt and incense. Moth points to a section of the northern wall, partially hidden by a large salt spike. "The crack the Nomads mentioned. It's still there." Lyra scans the perimeter with her tech-staff. "I'm reading minimal electronic surveillance. Their defenses are more... spiritual. But the sentries are vigilant. We'll need to move quickly and quietly."
[[Approach the hidden crack in the north wall->LibraryInfiltrate-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Have Lyra create a diversion to draw the sentries away from the north side->LibraryDiversion-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: RustRidgeFoothills-WithMoth-WithLyra
The Rust-Ridge mountains loom, their peaks clawing at the bruised sky. You stand with Moth and Lyra at the base of the range. Moth points out a narrow, winding trail. "A Nomad path. It's steep, but it bypasses the main Legion patrol routes on the southern face." Lyra consults her datapad. "The GeoCore Vault is in the tallest peak, Skybreaker. The Legion's land-trains have carved a road right to its base. Our best chance is to get above them."
[[Take the secret Nomad trail upward->MountainAscent-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Scout the Legion's position from a hidden vantage point first->MountainVantage-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryDiversion-WithMoth-WithLyra
Lyra nods and focuses her energy staff on a cluster of salt crystals some distance from the north wall. A low hum builds, and the crystals suddenly shatter with a loud crack that echoes across the flats. The Ashen Choir sentries turn their heads sharply toward the noise, shouting to each other and moving to investigate. "Now," Moth whispers, seizing the moment. She leads you and Lyra in a swift, silent dash toward the hidden crack in the Library's north wall, the sentries now distracted and looking the wrong way.
[[Enter the Library through the crack->LibraryEntrance-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryInfiltrate-WithMoth-WithLyra
Moving with practiced stealth, the three of you approach the north wall. The crack is narrow, barely wide enough to squeeze through, and hidden behind a large, spire-like formation of salt. Moth goes first, slipping inside like a shadow. You follow, with Lyra bringing up the rear, her staff momentarily dimmed. You find yourself in a dark, narrow corridor of rough-hewn stone, the air thick with the scent of old paper and damp earth. The sounds of the outside world are muffled. You have infiltrated the Sunken Library undetected.
[[Move deeper into the Library->LibraryHallway-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainAscent-WithMoth-WithLyra
The Nomad trail is steep and treacherous, a mere scratch on the mountainside known only to the Dustborn. Moth leads the way with sure-footed confidence, pointing out unstable rocks and safe handholds. Lyra follows, her tech-staff providing support on the sharper inclines. The climb is grueling, but it takes you high above the Legion's main road, offering glimpses of their camp far below through gaps in the rock. After hours of ascent, you reach a secluded ledge with a commanding view of the mountainside and the GeoCore Vault's main entrance.
[[Rest on the ledge and plan the next move->MountainLedge-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainVantage-WithMoth-WithLyra
From your hidden vantage point, you, Moth, and Lyra observe the Legion camp sprawled around the massive vault door. Lyra uses her datapad to zoom in on the activity. "They've set up a perimeter. The main door is heavily guarded, but look there," she points to a smaller, metallic door on the cliff face to the west, "a personnel entrance. Only two guards." Moth adds, "And I see a ventilation shaft grate just above it, partly covered by scrub. We could reach it if we get those guards to move."
[[Plan an approach to the personnel door->MountainPlanApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Wait and watch for a shift change or distraction->MountainVantageWait-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryEntrance-WithMoth-WithLyra
The corridor inside the Library is narrow and dark, the air thick with the smell of old parchment and damp stone. Moth leads the way, her movements silent and sure. Lyra keeps her tech-staff dimmed, its faint hum the only sound. After a short distance, the corridor opens into a wider hallway lined with empty stone alcoves that might once have held statues. Faint, rhythmic chanting echoes from somewhere deeper within the complex. Moth pauses, listening. "The central chambers are that way," she whispers, pointing down the hall. "The archives are to the left. We need to decide quickly before the sentries return to their posts."
[[Head toward the chanting in the central chambers->LibraryCentral-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Search the archives for the fragment->LibraryArchives-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryHallway-WithMoth-WithLyra
The hallway is long and stark, its stone walls bearing faded murals of a green world that no longer exists. The chanting grows louder, a monotonous drone that sets your nerves on edge. Moth points to a branching passage on the right, this one sloping downward. "That leads to the lower archives," she murmurs. "The most protected texts are kept down there, away from the main altar." Lyra checks a reading on her staff. "The energy signature is stronger in that direction. The fragment might be below."
[[Descend into the lower archives->LibraryLowerArchives-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Continue toward the source of the chanting->LibraryCentral-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainLedge-WithMoth-WithLyra
The ledge offers a breathtaking and terrifying view. Far below, the Legion camp is a hive of activity around the main vault door. The air is thin and cold. Moth scans the cliff face below you. "There's a series of handholds leading down to that ventilation shaft," she says, pointing. "It's a dangerous climb, but it's our best way in unseen." Lyra studies the Legion patrol patterns through her monocular. "The guards at the personnel door are complacent. If we can reach the shaft, we can bypass them entirely."
[[Attempt the dangerous climb down to the ventilation shaft->MountainDescentToShaft-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Wait for nightfall to make the descent under cover of darkness->MountainLedgeWait-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainPlanApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra
Lyra outlines a plan. "I can create a diversion near the main camp—a small energy burst that will look like a sensor malfunction. It should draw the guards from the personnel door long enough for you and Moth to reach the ventilation shaft." Moth nods. "Once the guards are gone, I can get the grate open quickly. But we have to move the second they look away."
[[Execute Lyra's diversion plan->MountainDiversionExecution-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Suggest a different approach, using Moth's knowledge of the terrain->MountainAlternativePlan-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainVantageWait-WithMoth-WithLyra
You settle into your hiding spot, the cold rock seeping through your clothes. Hours pass. The Legion camp goes through a shift change, but the new night watch is even more numerous and vigilant, their patrols overlapping with no clear gaps. The wait has cost you daylight and made the approach more difficult. Moth looks concerned. "Their guard has doubled. A direct approach now is even riskier."
[[Abandon the vantage point and search for another route up the mountain->MountainAscentSearch-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Risk a swift, silent approach despite the increased patrols->MountainNightApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryArchives-WithMoth-WithLyra
The lower archives are a cavernous space, shelves stretching up into darkness. The air is thick with the smell of crumbling paper and ancient dust. Lyra's staff casts a weak light on towering stacks of books and data-slates. Moth moves silently ahead, her fingers tracing the spines. "The Nomad tales say the fragment is kept in the 'Oracle's Nook', a sealed chamber at the far end," she whispers. A sudden sound of dragging footsteps echoes from a nearby aisle, and a shadow moves between the shelves. Someone, or something, is searching here too.
[[Press on toward the Oracle's Nook, ignoring the sound->LibraryNookApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Investigate the source of the footsteps->LibraryArchiveInvestigate-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryCentral-WithMoth-WithLyra
The central chamber is a vast dome illuminated by strange, phosphorescent fungi growing in intricate patterns on the walls. In the center, a massive stone altar stands empty. Dozens of Ashen Choir acolytes kneel in concentric circles, their low chanting filling the space with a hypnotic rhythm. A High Priestess in ash-gray robes stands before the altar, her back to you. She raises her arms, and the chanting rises in pitch. The fragment is not visible, but this is clearly the heart of the Choir's power within the Library.
[[Try to sneak around the perimeter of the chamber, searching for a side passage->LibraryCentralPerimeter-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Create a distraction to disrupt the ceremony and search the altar->LibraryCentralDistraction-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryLowerArchives-WithMoth-WithLyra
The stairs descend into a colder, damper level where the air smells of wet stone and mildew. The archives here are more haphazard, with scrolls and books piled on the floor in unstable mounds. Lyra's scanner beeps insistently. "The signal is very strong down here," she murmurs. At the far end of the chamber, a heavy iron door, scarred and old, stands slightly ajar. A faint blue light pulses from within. This must be the Oracle's Nook. But the floor is littered with debris, and moving quietly will be nearly impossible.
[[Approach the iron door carefully, stepping over the debris->LibraryNookDoor-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Search the nearby piles for any clues or dangers first->LibraryLowerPiles-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainAlternativePlan-WithMoth-WithLyra
"Let's use the terrain," you suggest. Moth nods enthusiastically. "I know a gully that winds around behind the personnel door. It's a longer route, but it comes out right above the ventilation shaft. We can drop down onto it instead of climbing." Lyra considers it. "A stealthy approach from above. It avoids the guards' sightlines entirely. It's a good plan." The alternative offers a chance to bypass the Legion's front-line vigilance completely.
[[Take the long gully route to approach from above->MountainGullyApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainAscentSearch-WithMoth-WithLyra
Abandoning the watched vantage point, you, Moth, and Lyra retreat and begin searching the base of the mountain for another path. Moth finds a narrow fissure hidden behind a waterfall of black, viscous water. "This isn't on any map," she says. "It might connect to the vault's lower levels." Lyra scans it. "The rock is unstable, but the seismic readings suggest a cavity beyond. It's a risk, but it's unguarded."
[[Enter the unstable fissure->MountainFissureEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainDescentToShaft-WithMoth-WithLyra
The climb down from the ledge is a heart-stopping exercise in precision. You descend first, finding tiny cracks and protrusions for your hands and feet. Moth follows, agile as a goat, and Lyra comes last, using her staff to brace herself. The wind whips around you, threatening to pluck you from the cliff face. After a tense, slow descent, you all reach a small ledge just above the ventilation shaft grate. The two Legion guards below are still chatting, unaware of the figures clinging to the rock above them.
[[Wait for the perfect moment to drop down to the grate->MountainShaftDrop-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainDiversionExecution-WithMoth-WithLyra
Lyra focuses her staff on a Legion comms array near the main camp. A burst of static screeches from their speakers, and lights on the console flicker erratically. The two guards at the personnel door snap to attention, looking toward the commotion. One of them gestures and they both jog toward the main camp to investigate. The path to the ventilation shaft is clear for a precious few moments.
[[Dash to the shaft with Moth and attempt entry->MountainShaftEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainLedgeWait-WithMoth-WithLyra
You huddle on the cold ledge as the sun sets and the temperature plummets. The Legion camp below lights up with lanterns and spotlights. The night patrols are more alert, but their vision is limited to the pools of light they create. Under the deep cover of darkness, the climb down becomes a game of shadow and silence. The guards at the personnel door are barely visible, their attention focused on the perimeter of their illuminated area.
[[Begin the silent descent under cover of night->MountainNightDescent-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainNightApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra
With the patrols too tight for a clean approach, you decide on a swift, silent rush. You, Moth, and Lyra move like ghosts down from the vantage point, using every scrap of cover. You flit from shadow to shadow, your movements timed to the patrols' backs being turned. It's a high-risk strategy, a continuous test of timing and stealth. You reach the rockfall near the personnel door, the ventilation grate just a short sprint away across open ground.
[[Make the final dash to the ventilation shaft->MountainFinalDash-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryArchiveInvestigate-WithMoth-WithLyra
You signal to Moth and Lyra to follow the sound. Peering around a towering shelf, you see a hunched, robed figure—a Choir Librarian—methodically pulling books from a shelf and tossing them into a pile on the floor, muttering about "unclean knowledge." He hasn't noticed you yet. This could be an opportunity to learn where the fragment is hidden, or a risk of immediate confrontation.
[[Attempt to sneak past the distracted Librarian toward the Nook->LibraryNookApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Confront the Librarian and demand information->LibraryArchiveConfront-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryCentralDistraction-WithMoth-WithLyra
Lyra nods and aims her staff at a cluster of the glowing fungi high on the dome's ceiling. She emits a precise energy pulse. One of the fungi explodes in a shower of harmless but bright sparks. The chanting stops instantly as acolytes cry out and look up. The High Priestess spins around, her face a mask of fury. In the confusion, the altar is unguarded for a moment.
[[Rush to the altar and search it for the fragment->LibraryAltarSearch-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryCentralPerimeter-WithMoth-WithLyra
Staying deep in the shadows along the curved wall, you, Moth, and Lyra creep around the edge of the vast chamber. The acolytes are focused on their chanting, their backs to the perimeter. You find a small, arched doorway hidden behind a heavy tapestry. It leads into a dark, narrow corridor that seems to spiral upward. This might be a way to a higher level, perhaps where more valuable items are kept.
[[Enter the hidden corridor->LibrarySpiralStairs-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryLowerPiles-WithMoth-WithLyra
You carefully sift through the nearest pile of discarded texts. Most are water-damaged and illegible. Under a collapsed stack of engineering manuals, Lyra finds a small, active datapad. Its screen shows a real-time schematic of the Library, with a blinking dot marking the iron door of the Oracle's Nook. It also shows several other moving dots—Choir patrols—none of which are currently nearby. This gives you a crucial advantage.
[[Use the datapad's map to approach the Nook stealthily->LibraryNookDoor-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryNookApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra
Ignoring the other sounds, you focus on the pulsing blue light from the iron door. You, Moth, and Lyra pick your way through the labyrinth of shelves, your movements silent. You reach the heavy door without further incident. It is cold to the touch, and the blue light bleeds through the crack. The air here is charged with static.
[[Push the iron door open and enter->LibraryNookInside-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryNookDoor-WithMoth-WithLyra
The iron door is heavy and scrapes loudly on the stone floor as you push it open. The sound echoes in the silent lower archives. The room within is small and circular, lit by a single, glowing data-cube resting on a stone pedestal—the third map fragment. An old man in tattered robes sits cross-legged before it, muttering to himself. It is Dr. Oren Vale.
[[Take the data-cube->LibraryFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: MountainFinalDash-WithMoth-WithLyra
You exchange a look with Moth and Lyra. Now. You break from the cover of the rocks and sprint across the open ground toward the ventilation shaft. A Legion sentry shouts and raises his rifle. Lyra fires a energy pulse from her staff, forcing him to duck. Moth reaches the grate first and begins prying it open with a tool. Shots ring out, sparking against the metal near your head.
[[Dive into the open shaft->MountainShaftEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainFissureEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra
The fissure is a tight, wet squeeze. Black water drips on you as you push through. The tunnel beyond is unstable, with loose rocks underfoot. It descends sharply into darkness. Lyra's staff provides the only light. After a precarious descent, the tunnel opens into a low, flooded chamber. A rusted ladder leads up to a ceiling hatch marked "GeoCore Vault - Sub-level 3." This is a back door, but the flooding is a new obstacle.
[[Attempt to bypass the flooded chamber->MountainFloodedChamber-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainGullyApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra
Moth leads you up a steep, hidden gully that winds behind the Legion's position. The going is slow but completely concealed from the camp below. You climb for an hour, emerging onto a narrow ledge directly above the ventilation shaft. Looking down, you see the two guards still at their post, oblivious. You are now in a perfect position to drop down onto the shaft's grate from above.
[[Signal to drop down onto the grate->MountainShaftDrop-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainNightDescent-WithMoth-WithLyra
Under the cloak of night, you begin the slow, silent climb down the cliff face. You move inch by inch, your grip firm on the cold rock. Moth is a shadow below you, Lyra above. The Legion's spotlights sweep the area, but you freeze each time they pass, becoming part of the mountain itself. After a tense, grueling descent, you all reach the small ledge above the ventilation shaft. The guards below are huddled near a heater, their attention inward.
[[Drop down to the grate while the guards are distracted->MountainShaftDrop-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainShaftDrop-WithMoth-WithLyra
You drop the short distance onto the metal grate of the ventilation shaft, landing as quietly as possible. Moth and Lyra land beside you. The grate is held by rusty bolts. The guards below, still chatting, don't seem to have heard the soft thuds. You have a moment to work before they notice.
[[Pry open the grate and slip inside->MountainShaftEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainShaftEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra
Moth quickly pries the grate open with a crowbar. You slip into the dark, vertical shaft, followed by Moth and then Lyra. The grate closes above you with a faint clang. You are inside the mountain, descending into the metal innards of the GeoCore Vault. The sound of the Legion camp is replaced by the deep, resonant hum of ancient machinery.
[[Descend the shaft into the vault->GeoCoreVentEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreVentEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra
The ventilation shaft is a tight, vertical drop into the humming heart of the mountain. Moth leads the descent with a quiet confidence, finding handholds in the rusted metal rungs. Lyra follows, her tech-staff casting a dim, blue light that illuminates the dust motes dancing in the stale air. The deep thrum of the vault's machinery grows louder with each step downward. The shaft ends at a horizontal grate, offering a view into a vast, dimly lit cavern far below—the main chamber of the GeoCore Vault.
[[Peer through the grate to scout the cavern below->GeoCoreGantryScout-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryAltarSearch-WithMoth-WithLyra
In the chaotic aftermath of the fungal explosion, you dash to the stone altar. Moth and Lyra flank you, watching for any acolytes who might recover from the surprise. The altar surface is smooth and cool. Your hands search its edges and find a hidden compartment that slides open with a soft click. Inside lies not a data-cube, but a heavy, leather-bound journal. The cover bears the insignia of the Technic Union and the name "Oren Vale." The fragment must be elsewhere.
[[Take the journal and retreat from the central chamber->LibraryArchives-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryArchiveConfront-WithMoth-WithLyra
You step out from behind the shelves. "Where is the map fragment?" The hunched Librarian spins around, his eyes wide with shock and fury. "Blasphemer! The Oracle's knowledge is not for your kind!" He throws a cloud of corrosive dust from his robes, forcing you to shield your eyes. Moth reacts instantly, tackling the Librarian and pinning him to the ground. The confrontation is loud and will attract others.
[[Demand the location of the fragment from the subdued Librarian->LibraryArchiveInterrogate-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
You reach for the glowing data-cube on the pedestal. As your fingers close around it, the old man, Dr. Vale, looks up, his eyes clearing for a moment. "You have it," he whispers. "The key to the sorrow. But the final lock is in the heart." Lyra steps forward, her voice gentle. "We need your help, Doctor. The Vault of Lament awaits." Moth keeps watch at the door, listening for approaching Choir patrols drawn by the noise.
[[Urge Dr. Vale to join your group and leave the Library->LibraryEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: LibraryNookInside-WithMoth-WithLyra
The iron door groans shut behind you. The small, circular room is dominated by the pulsing data-cube on its stone pedestal. The air crackles with static. The hunched figure of Dr. Oren Vale mutters incoherently, tracing patterns in the dust on the floor. He seems unaware of your presence. The third map fragment is within reach, but the old scientist is a complication.
[[Approach the pedestal and take the data-cube->LibraryFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: LibrarySpiralStairs-WithMoth-WithLyra
The hidden corridor winds upward in a tight spiral. The air grows colder. You emerge into a small, circular observatory at the top of a Library tower. A large, ancient telescope points through a slit in the dome at the ash-gray sky. On a reading desk beneath it sits a sealed metal case. Lyra scans it. "The energy signature is inside. This is it." But the case is locked with a complex mechanical puzzle.
[[Attempt to solve the puzzle lock on the case->LibraryObservatoryPuzzle-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainFloodedChamber-WithMoth-WithLyra
The chamber is knee-deep in freezing, black water. The ladder to the ceiling hatch is slick with rust and algae. Lyra tests the water with a sensor. "It's contaminated, but not acutely toxic. We can wade through." Moth points to a partially submerged control panel on the far wall. "That might operate a pump or open a drain." The choice is to risk the water or try to lower its level.
[[Wade through the contaminated water to the ladder->MountainFloodedWade-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Attempt to use the submerged control panel->MountainFloodedPanel-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreGantryScout-WithMoth-WithLyra
Peering through the metal grate, you see a breathtaking sight far below: the main cavern of the GeoCore Vault, a vast space filled with the skeletons of colossal machinery. A crystal data-shard pulses with a soft blue light on a central pedestal. A hologram of an old man flickers beside it. The air hums with dormant power. The main entrance on the far side is sealed shut. For now, the cavern appears empty and silent. The gantry you are on circles the perimeter high above the floor, offering a precarious path.
[[Descend the gantry stairs to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Follow the gantry to search for a control room->GeoCoreControlRoom-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryArchiveInterrogate-WithMoth-WithLyra
Moth holds the struggling Librarian firmly. "The fragment! Where is it?" you demand. The Librarian spits, "The Oracle's Nook! The blasphemous key is with the madman! But the Choir will stop you!" He lets out a piercing shriek before Moth can gag him. The cry echoes through the archives. The sound of running feet answers from several directions. You have the information, but you have also alerted the entire Library to your presence.
[[Run for the Oracle's Nook before the guards arrive->LibraryNookApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
You grab the dazed Dr. Vale and push him toward the door. "We have to go, now!" Shouts echo from the archives as Choir Sentries respond to the earlier noise. You, Moth, and Lyra burst out of the Nook and into the corridors, Vale stumbling between you. The Sentries round a corner, their blades drawn. "The Oracle! Protect the Oracle!" one cries, hesitating at the sight of Vale. You use their confusion to dash down a side passage, heading for an exit.
[[Flee the Library with your newfound allies->SaltFlatsEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: LibraryObservatoryPuzzle-WithMoth-WithLyra
The metal case is sealed with an intricate lock consisting of rotating rings marked with astrological symbols. Lyra studies it. "It's an old-world puzzle lock. The symbols need to be aligned to a specific constellation." Moth traces the carvings. "The Nomad stories mention the 'Sorrowful Star' that appeared after the Cataclysm. Maybe that's the key." The three of you work together, turning the rings until the pattern matches the tales of the lost star. With a soft click, the case unlocks.
[[Open the case and take the fragment inside->LibraryFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainFloodedPanel-WithMoth-WithLyra
Lyra wades through the filthy water to the submerged control panel. She clears the grime from the screen, her tech-staff providing light. The display flickers to life, showing a schematic of the chamber's drainage system. "I can activate the pump," she says, inputting a command. A low grinding sound begins, and the water level slowly starts to drop, swirling around a central drain. After a few minutes, the chamber is merely damp, revealing the slick ladder clearly.
[[Climb the now-accessible ladder to the hatch->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: MountainFloodedWade-WithMoth-WithLyra
Ignoring the panel, you wade into the icy, contaminated water. It soaks through your boots, a cold shock. Moth and Lyra follow. The going is slow, the sludge-like water pulling at your legs. You reach the base of the rusty ladder, its rungs slippery with algae. Moth climbs first, testing each step. You follow, the ladder groaning under the weight. Lyra brings up the rear. It is an unpleasant and risky ascent, but it gets you to the hatch above.
[[Open the hatch and enter the vault->GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth-WithLyra
The metal corridor opens into a breathtaking underground cavern, vast enough to swallow the old world's largest structures. You stand with Moth and Lyra on a metal gantry high above the floor, where a crystal data-shard pulses with soft blue light on a central pedestal. A flickering hologram of Dr. Oren Vale materializes beside it. "I am Dr. Oren Vale," the recording intones, its voice echoing. "Haven-0 is real, but its power requires a final, terrible sacrifice that will consume the facility." Moth grips your arm, her face pale, while Lyra studies the hologram with a technomancer's sharp gaze, absorbing the grim warning.
[[Take the second map fragment->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]
[[Listen to the full message from the hologram->ValeRecording-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreControlRoom-WithMoth-WithLyra
The gantry leads to a small control room overlooking the main cavern. Dust-covered consoles display flickering schematics of the vault's systems. Lyra brushes a screen clear. "I can trigger a lockdown from here," she whispers. "It would seal the main door, trapping the Legion outside. But it's a one-way command. It might seal us in." Moth looks from Lyra to you, her expression uncertain. "A locked door keeps trouble out, but it also locks it in with us."
[[Initiate the lockdown->ControlRoomLockdown-WithMoth-WithLyra]]
[[Leave the controls and descend to the cavern floor->GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: GeoCoreVaultEntrance-WithMoth-WithLyra
You push open the ceiling hatch from the flooded chamber and emerge into a stark, metal-lined corridor deep within the GeoCore Vault. The air is cool and hums with the vibration of ancient machinery. Moth and Lyra climb out behind you, dripping with contaminated water. Lyra immediately scans the corridor with her staff. "This is a service level. The main cavern should be ahead." The path slopes downward, a faint blue glow beckoning from around a bend. You have infiltrated the vault from an unexpected direction, your small group intact.
[[Proceed cautiously toward the glow->GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: LibraryFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra
You open the unlocked metal case in the Library observatory. Inside, resting on a velvet lining, is the third map fragment—a data-cube identical to the rumors. It glows with a steady, warm light. Moth lets out a soft sigh of relief. "We found it." Lyra pockets the cube, her expression serious. "The Choir will be searching for us now that we've taken their prize. We need to leave immediately." The sound of distant, angry shouts from below confirms her warning. The fragment is yours, but the Library is now a hostile cage.
[[Flee the observatory and find an escape route->LibraryEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: SaltFlatsEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
You, Moth, Lyra, and the disoriented Dr. Vale burst out of a hidden Library exit into the blinding white expanse of the salt flats. The cries of the Ashen Choir Sentries fade behind you, muffled by the thick stone walls. Dr. Vale stumbles, and Moth steadies him. Lyra scans the horizon, her tech-staff humming. "The Choir won't give up easily. We need to put distance between us and this place." The three map fragments are now secured, and you have gained a potentially invaluable, if unstable, ally in Dr. Vale.
[[Head for the Forbidden Zone, the final fragment's supposed location->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: ControlRoomLockdown-WithMoth-WithLyra
Lyra inputs the command. A deep, resonant thud echoes through the mountain as the massive main vault door slams shut and locks. The hum of the vault's machinery is now the only sound. "We're locked in," Moth says, her voice small in the vast control room. "But so is the Legion. They won't be breaking in now." The decision seals your fate within the mountain alongside the fragment.
[[Descend to the cavern floor to claim the shard->GeoCoreCavern-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
The Forbidden Zone is a raging wound in the earth, a perpetual storm of ash and energy. You stand with Moth and Lyra, the three map fragments humming in unison within your pack. Dr. Vale shivers beside you, his eyes fixed on the maelstrom. "The final key is not out there," he murmurs. "It is a lock that reads the heart. We carry the sorrow with us." The path ahead is a test of spirit as much as survival.
[[Approach the vault entrance directly, trusting your shared resolve->ZoneVaultEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]
[[Search for a calmer path to prepare for the emotional trial->ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
You take the crystal shard. It clicks into place with your first fragment, the glow intensifying to reveal a more detailed path on the combined map. The hologram of Dr. Vale flickers and fades, its warning delivered. "Two keys," Lyra states, her voice echoing in the silent, locked cavern. Moth looks toward the ventilation shaft, your only exit. "The Legion is outside, but we have what we came for."
[[Escape through the maintenance tunnel->GeoCoreEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: LibraryEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra
Shouts and the clatter of armored feet echo through the stone corridors. You clutch the data-cube, the third fragment secured. Moth leads the way, darting down a side passage, while Lyra guards the rear, her staff crackling with defensive energy. You burst out of a hidden doorway into the blinding light of the salt flats, leaving the angry cries of the Ashen Choir behind. You are free, but pursued.
[[Flee across the salt flats with your allies->SaltFlatsEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra]]

:: ValeRecording-WithMoth-WithLyra
The hologram of Dr. Vale continues, its tone grave. "The energy required is catastrophic. Haven-0's core cannot contain the reaction. It was designed as a single-use event. To clear the sky, Haven-0 must be destroyed. Anyone inside when the sequence is initiated will be part of the sacrifice." The warning hangs in the humming cavern, a grim truth shared between you, Moth, and Lyra.
[[Take the fragment, accepting the terrible cost->GeoCoreFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreEscape-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
You and Lyra scramble back up the narrow maintenance tunnel, the silent, sealed vault falling away below. Moth leads the way with practiced ease. You emerge onto the windy mountainside, the second fragment secure. The Legion camp is a distant, angry hive of activity at the main entrance, unaware of your escape route. Lyra checks the horizon. "The lockdown bought us time, but they'll scour this mountain. We need to get to the foothills fast."
[[Descend the mountain carefully->RidgeDescent-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: ZoneCircuitousRoute-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
Moth sets the pace, leading you and Lyra on a long, winding path around the perimeter of the Forbidden Zone. Dr. Vale follows, his steps slow but determined. The three map fragments create a harmonious thrum, their combined light seeming to soothe the turbulent energy fields at the edge of the storm. "The direct path is for haste," Moth explains, "but the long path is for the heart." The journey is meditative, almost peaceful. You finally approach the vault from a high, serene overlook, the entrance a dark but calm opening below.
[[Descend the peaceful path to the vault entrance->ZoneVaultApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
You step through the dark archway into the Vault of Lament with Moth and Lyra. Dr. Vale follows, a frail figure between you. The furious noise of the storm vanishes, replaced by an absolute, heavy silence. The three map fragments in your pack hum with a strong, clear frequency, a chord of purpose in the stillness. The air is cold and perfectly still. Ahead, the cavern opens into a vast expanse of darkness, a single, soft pulse of light beckoning from the center. The journey has converged on this moment of truth.
[[Approach the central light->ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: RidgeDescent-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
The descent from Skybreaker is a careful, silent retreat. You, Moth, and Lyra move with practiced stealth, the second map fragment a shared secret in your pack. The Legion camp is a distant rumble below, their searchlights sweeping the lower slopes. Moth finds goat trails invisible to the Legion's eyes, while Lyra monitors their comms chatter on her datapad, listening for any sign they've discovered the hidden exit. The wind carries the taste of ash and the promise of the long journey ahead to the Forbidden Zone.
[[Set a course for the edge of the maelstrom->ForbiddenZoneEdge-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultApproach-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
The path carved by your shared sorrow leads you, Moth, and Lyra into a sheltered basin on the edge of the Forbidden Zone. The air is still, a stark contrast to the energy storms raging at the basin's rim. Ahead, the entrance to the Vault of Lament is a simple, dark archway in the mountainside, unadorned and waiting. The three map fragments in your pack hum in perfect harmony, their light a gentle counterpoint to the surrounding chaos. Dr. Vale walks forward, his step firmer now. "The door is open to us," he says quietly.
[[Enter the vault together->ZoneVaultEntry-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren]]

:: ZoneVaultCavern-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren
The cavern is a cathedral of black stone, vast and deeply silent. The air is cool and carries a sense of immense patience. In the very center, the Catalyst Orb rests on a stone dais, pulsing with a soft, welcoming light that illuminates the entire space. The three map fragments resonate with it, the sound a peaceful hum. There are no defenses, no traps—only the quiet expectation of the final key meeting its lock. Dr. Vale gestures toward the orb. "The sorrow was the key. The map is the proof. Take it, and let us end this journey."
[[Take the final fragment->ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren-HasAllFragments]]

:: ZoneVaultFragmentTaken-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren-HasAllFragments
The Catalyst Orb is cool and smooth in your hand. The three physical fragments and this newly manifested key merge, the light from the completed map casting a brilliant, detailed hologram of Haven-0's valley into the silent air of the cavern. The vault itself seems to sigh, a deep, resonant hum that is one of release, not threat. A previously hidden door slides open in the far wall, revealing a path back to the outside world. Moth looks at the map, her face full of awe. Lyra gives a grim, satisfied nod. Dr. Vale places a trembling hand on your shoulder. "The road is clear. The final choice awaits at the end of it."
[[Leave the vault and begin the final pilgrimage->ForbiddenZoneExit-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren-HasAllFragments]]

:: ForbiddenZoneExit-WithMoth-WithLyra-MetOren-HasAllFragments
You, Moth, Lyra, and Dr. Vale emerge from the silent vault of sorrow into the fringes of the Forbidden Zone. The completed map projects a steady, unwavering beacon toward the secluded valley of Haven-0. The chaotic storms seem to part before the map's light, creating a path of eerie calm through the devastation. Moth steadies Dr. Vale as he stumbles on the glassy ground. Lyra scans the horizon, her tech now functioning perfectly in the map's protective field. "The path is clear," she says, her voice filled with a strange mixture of dread and hope. "The factions will be waiting. But we have what they all desire." The final march begins.
[[Begin the pilgrimage to Haven-0->Haven0Approach-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]

:: Haven0Approach-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
You, Moth, Lyra, and Dr. Vale stand on a high ridge, looking down into the secluded valley where Haven-0 lies. The arcology is a breathtaking marvel of preserved pre-Cataclysm engineering, its curved white walls untouched by the ash that blankets the world. Below, the factions have converged in a tense standoff at the main entrance: a Legion patrol in polished armor, Ashen Choir zealots in gray robes chanting before a smoking altar, and silent Technic Union observers flanked by hovering drones. They all know you have the completed map. Moth points to a fissure in the valley wall. "A goat path. It winds behind the arcology's shield wall." Lyra's tech-staff hums. "Their sensors are focused on each other. We can slip past." Dr. Vale's voice is a whisper. "The final choice cannot be made by them. It must be ours, alone in the quiet heart of the machine."

:: Haven0Assault-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
A roar rips from your throat, a signal to charge. You, Moth, Lyra, and Dr. Vale explode from cover and sprint down the steep slope toward the main entrance of Haven-0. The assembled factions reel in shock at the sudden, unified assault. Legion rifles snap up, Choir zealots shriek and draw blades, Union drones pivot with lethal precision. Moth is a whirlwind, her agility drawing fire away from the frail Dr. Vale. Lyra's staff unleashes pulses of energy, creating brief shields and disrupting aim. You lay down covering fire, a desperate storm of your own against the converging enemy lines. It is a mad, violent dash through a gauntlet of opposing ideologies made manifest as gunfire and steel.
[[Reach the massive, sculpted entrance doors->Haven0Entrance-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]

:: Haven0Infiltrate-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
While the Legion, Choir, and Union glare at each other, you melt into the shadows of the ridge. Moth leads the way to a narrow fissure she spotted, hidden by petrified scrub. You, Lyra, and Dr. Vale squeeze through the tight crack, emerging into a cold, dark space behind the arcology's monumental shield wall. The sounds of the standoff are muffled, replaced by the hum of Haven-0's own dormant systems. A service panel, its lock long-frozen, yields to Lyra's tech. You slip inside a dusty maintenance conduit, deep within the arcology's skeleton. The factions are left arguing at the gate, unaware you have already bypassed them entirely.
[[Follow the conduit toward the facility's heart->Haven0Core-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]

:: Haven0Parley-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
You step into the open ground between the factions, your allies flanking you. The completed map glows brilliantly in your upheld hand. "This doesn't have to end in bloodshed! Haven-0 can be a beginning for all!" Moth speaks of the Nomad dream of a free sky. Lyra argues for shared knowledge. Dr. Vale explains the terrible, necessary sacrifice. Captain Hale barks about order. A Choir Priestess screams of blasphemy. A Union envoy demands cold control. The fundamental beliefs clash like tectonic plates. Your words, meant to unite, only sharpen the divisions. The valley tenses, and then fractures. A single shot rings out, and the fragile peace shatters into open war.
[[The battle for Haven-0 begins->Haven0Battle-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]

:: Haven0Battle-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
The valley erupts into a vortex of violence. Legion troopers fire disciplined volleys into the chanting Choir ranks. Zealots charge with fanatical fury, their ceremonial blades flashing. Union drones sweep the field with precise energy beams, targeting all combatants indiscriminately. You, Moth, Lyra, and Dr. Vale are pinned in the center of this storm. Moth deflects a Legion bayonet with a quick parry, while Lyra's staff creates a shimmering energy barrier that absorbs a drone's blast. Dr. Vale huddles behind a rock, his face pale. A Choir zealot breaks through, his eyes burning with fervor, and lunges for the old scientist. You intercept the attack, the clash of steel ringing out over the chaos. The path to the arcology's door is a gauntlet of crossfire and clashing ideologies.
[[Fight through the melee toward the entrance, protecting your companions->Haven0Entrance-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]

:: Haven0Entrance-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
The massive, sculpted door of Haven-0 slams shut with a final, resonant boom, sealing out the cacophony of the faction war. You, Moth, Lyra, and Dr. Vale stand panting in the sudden, immense silence of the reception hall. The air is startlingly pure and cool, a shocking contrast to the ash-choked valley. Moth brushes gray dust from her robes, her eyes wide as she gazes at the soaring, pristine architecture. Lyra immediately scans the atrium with her tech-staff, its blue light gliding over smooth, unblemished walls. Dr. Vale stumbles forward, running a trembling hand over a console. "The life-support systems... still perfect," he whispers in awe. Ahead, a broad, descending corridor, illuminated by soft strips of light, leads into the heart of the arcology. The completed map in your hand has fallen silent, its guiding task complete. Only the final decision remains.
[[Proceed down the main corridor toward the control center->Haven0Core-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments]]

:: Haven0Core-WithMoth-WithLyra-WithOren-HasAllFragments
The core chamber is a cathedral of technology, vast and humming with dormant power. You stand with Moth, Lyra, and Dr. Vale before the central control terminal, a complex array of screens and interfaces that glow with soft light. The completed map projects the final activation sequence into the air. Dr. Vale places a shaking hand on the console. "The purifier can be activated," he says, his voice echoing in the silence. "But the energy required is a matter-antimatter annihilation. The facility, and everyone in it, will be consumed. This was the intended sacrifice." Lyra meets your gaze, her expression resolute. Moth stands firm beside you. The weight of the world's future rests on your next command.
