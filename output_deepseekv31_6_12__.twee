:: StoryStart
The air tastes of metal and cinders. You are the Wanderer, moving through a landscape permanently stained by the Ashfall Cataclysm. Your cloak is thick with grime. In your pack, a charred piece of polymer, a map fragment, feels heavier than it should. A storm is brewing on the horizon.

[[Seek immediate shelter from the storm.->AshRavine-StormApproaches]]
[[Press on toward the distant lights of a settlement.->OutpostGates-StormApproaches]]

:: AshRavine-StormApproaches
You scramble down into a deep ravine, the wind whipping ash into a stinging veil. A narrow cave entrance offers refuge. Inside, the roar of the storm is muted. Someone else is already here, huddled over a faint glow.

[[Approach the stranger cautiously.->AshRavine-MetLyra]]
[[Stay back in the shadows, observing.->AshRavine-Alone]]

:: OutpostGates-StormApproaches
The settlement's gates are massive, welded from scrap metal. Guards on the parapets eye you suspiciously. One shouts down, his voice barely audible over the rising wind. "State your business, drifter!"

[[Claim you have valuable information.->OutpostGates-Information]]
[[Ask for shelter from the storm, offering to trade.->OutpostGates-Trade]]

:: AshRavine-MetLyra
The stranger is a woman, her face illuminated by a handheld device displaying shifting weather patterns. She looks up, not startled. "The storm will last six hours. You're safe to share the space." She introduces herself as Lyra. Her eyes flick to your pack.

[[Ask about her device.->AshRavine-LyraTechnomancy]]
[[Remain silent and keep your distance.->AshRavine-Alone]]

:: OutpostGates-Information
You mention the map fragment. The guards exchange a look. The gate creaks open just enough for you to slip through. Inside, a stern man in a commander's uniform awaits. "Captain Bronn Hale. Let's talk about this map."

[[Follow Captain Hale.->SteelLegionCamp-MetBronn]]

:: OutpostGates-Trade
You offer some salvaged components. The guards accept them and let you pass. The outpost is cramped and noisy. A young courier, struggling with a heavy crate, accidentally bumps into you.

[[Help the courier.->OutpostMarket-MetMoth]]
[[Ignore the courier and find a bunk.->OutpostBunks-Alone]]

:: AshRavine-WithLyra
Lyra joins you as you leave the ravine. "The next logical location for a fragment would be near the old Skybreaker spire," she says, pointing southeast. "But it's dangerous territory."

[[Travel toward the Skybreaker spire with Lyra.->SkybreakerApproach-WithLyra]]

:: SteelLegionCamp-MetBronn
Captain Bronn Hale's tent is Spartan and orderly. "Haven-0 is a myth," he states bluntly. "But the fragments represent power. Power the Legion can use to bring order. Hand it over, and you'll have a place with us."

[[Hand over the fragment.->SteelLegionCamp-JoinedLegion]]
[[Refuse and try to leave.->SteelLegionCamp-RefusedBronn]]

:: OutpostBunks-Alone
You rest fitfully among strangers. At dawn, you slip out of the outpost unnoticed. The map fragment feels like a target on your back.

[[Head toward the Nomad gathering grounds.->NomadCaravan-Alone]]
[[Search for Technic Union contacts.->UnionOutpost-Alone]]
:: SkybreakerApproach-WithLyra
The skeletal ruins of the Skybreaker spire loom ahead. Lyra points to a service hatch at the base, half-buried in ash. "The entrance to the sublevels. This is where the second fragment's signal is strongest."

[[Enter the sublevels.->SkybreakerSublevel1-WithLyra]]

:: NomadCaravan-WithMoth
Moth introduces you to the caravan elders. With Moth's vouching, you are welcomed warmly. The elders confirm they guard a second map fragment, a piece of their history. They are willing to discuss it.

[[Speak with the elders about the fragment.->NomadElderTent-WithMoth]]

:: SteelLegionCamp-JoinedLegion
You are given a Legion uniform. Bronn Hale assigns you to a squad tasked with securing the second fragment from the Nomads. "They are hoarders of the past. We are the future."

[[Lead the squad to the Nomad grounds.->NomadCaravan-LegionThreat]]

:: SteelLegionCamp-RefusedBronn
Bronn's expression darkens. "A mistake." Guards seize you and take your fragment.

[[Plan an escape.->LegionCell-Captured]]
:: SkybreakerSublevel1-WithLyra
The sublevel is dark, lit only by Lyra's device. Corridors branch off into darkness. A low hum vibrates through the floor. Lyra warns, "The structure is unstable. And we are not alone."

[[Follow the humming sound.->SkybreakerSublevel2-WithLyra]]
[[Search a side corridor for the fragment.->SkybreakerArchive-WithLyra]]

:: NomadElderTent-WithMoth
With Moth beside you, the elder is receptive. "Moth speaks highly of you. The fragment is yours, if you vow to let a Nomad guide you to the next piece." Moth looks at you hopefully.

[[Accept the fragment and Moth's guidance.->NomadElderTent-WithMothAndFragment]]
[[Accept the fragment but go alone.->NomadElderTent-FragmentOnly]]

:: SteelLegionCamp-Captured
You are disarmed and marched to the Legion camp. Captain Hale confiscates your fragment. "You had potential. Now you have nothing."

[[Wait for an opportunity.->LegionCell-Captured-NoFragment]]
:: LegionCell-Captured
Days pass. During a shift change, you notice a flaw in the cell door lock. A sympathetic guard sometimes looks the other way.

[[Try to pick the lock with a scrap of metal.->LegionCell-EscapeAttempt]]
[[Convince the sympathetic guard to help.->LegionCell-GuardAlliance]]
:: SkybreakerSublevel2-WithLyra
The humming grows louder. You enter a large chamber filled with ancient machinery. In the center, on a console, glows the second map fragment. But the room is occupied by figures in grey robes—the Ashen Choir.

[[Confront the cultists.->SkybreakerShrine-Confrontation]]
[[Attempt to sneak past them.->SkybreakerShrine-Stealth]]

:: SkybreakerArchive-WithLyra
[[Continue your search.->SkybreakerSublevel1-WithLyraAndFragment2]]
:: NomadElderTent-TrustGained
The elder nods, satisfied. "The path is yours to walk. May the winds guide you."

[[Travel to the Skybreaker spire.->SkybreakerApproach-Fragment2]]
:: Ending-Betrayal
The Nomads exile you into the deepest wastes. Without allies or honor, you are just another ghost swallowed by the ash.
:: NomadElderTent-WithMothAndFragment
You accept the fragment, and Moth grins, packing a light kit. "I know the quickest ways," they say. You have a loyal companion and the second fragment.

[[Set out for the Skybreaker spire with Moth.->SkybreakerApproach-WithMothAndFragment2]]

:: NomadElderTent-FragmentOnly
You accept the fragment from the elder. Moth's face falls, but they respect your decision. You leave the caravan alone.

[[Travel to the Skybreaker spire.->SkybreakerApproach-Fragment2]]
:: SkybreakerApproach-WithScanner
[[Enter the spire.->SkybreakerSublevel1-WithScanner]]
:: LegionCell-GuardAlliance
The guard, named Elara, whispers, "I hate what the Legion has become." She slips you a key. "Your gear is in the armory. Go, before Hale returns." Your map fragment is secure.
[[Follow Elara's directions to the armory.->LegionArmory-Escape]]
:: SkybreakerShrine-Confrontation
The cultists turn, their eyes wide with fervor. "You would defy the sacred ash!" they cry. They attack without warning.

[[Fight your way to the fragment.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight]]
[[Try to reason with them.->SkybreakerShrine-Reason]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-Stealth
You and Lyra move along the shadows of the machinery. You are almost to the console when a cultist spots you and raises the alarm.

[[Grab the fragment and run.->SkybreakerShrine-GrabAndRun]]
[[Stand your ground and fight.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight]]

:: SkybreakerApproach-WithFragment2
[[Enter the spire.->SkybreakerSublevel1-WithFragment2]]
:: SkybreakerApproach-WithMothAndFragment2
With two fragments and Moth's guidance, you make good time. The path to the GeoCore Vault is treacherous, but Moth knows a hidden route.

[[Take the hidden route.->ForbiddenZone-MothRoute]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel1-WithScanner
The scanner reveals a faint energy signature leading deeper into the spire. It guides you past unstable corridors toward a large chamber. A low hum vibrates through the floor.

[[Follow the scanner's signal.->SkybreakerSublevel2-WithScanner]]
:: Ending-Vermin
The creatures of the deep wastes claim another victim. Your quest ends in darkness and pain.
:: SkybreakerShrine-Fight
You snatch the fragment from the console. You and Lyra sprint from the chamber, the cries of the cultists echoing behind you. You escape into the corridors with the second fragment.

[[Regroup in a safer part of the sublevel.->SkybreakerSublevel1-WithLyraAndFragment2]]
:: SkybreakerShrine-GrabAndRun
You snatch the fragment from the console. You and Lyra sprint from the chamber, the cries of the cultists echoing behind you. You escape into the corridors.

[[Regroup in a safer part of the sublevel.->SkybreakerSublevel1-WithLyraAndFragment2]]
:: SkybreakerSublevel1-WithLyraAndFragment2
You have the second fragment. Lyra patches up her minor scrapes. "The third fragment is the most protected," she says. "The GeoCore Vault. It will be a trial."

[[Vow to see the journey through.->ForbiddenZone-WithLyra]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel1-WithFragment2
The sublevel is dark. Corridors branch off into darkness. A low hum vibrates through the floor. You have the second fragment. Lyra is with you.

[[Follow the humming sound.->SkybreakerSublevel2-WithFragment2]]
[[Search a side corridor.->SkybreakerArchive-WithFragment2]]
:: ForbiddenZone-MothRoute
Moth leads you through a canyon that bypasses the worst of the zone's hazards. You arrive at the vault door unseen. "This is it," Moth whispers.

[[Examine the vault door.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-WithMoth]]

:: ForbiddenZone-WithLyra
[[Approach the vault door.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-DisableTurrets]]
:: GeoCoreVaultDoor-Alone
The massive vault door stands before you, unguarded. The path is clear. You are alone.

[[Attempt to open the door.->GeoCoreVaultChamber-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreVaultDoor-WithMoth
Moth points to a maintenance hatch hidden beneath debris. "This might lead to a control room inside. It's a tight squeeze."

[[Enter the maintenance hatch.->GeoCoreVaultInner-WithMoth]]

:: GeoCoreVaultDoor-DisableTurrets
[[Enter the vault.->GeoCoreVaultChamber-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreVaultDoor-Dash
You sprint. The turrets spin up and fire. You feel a searing pain in your leg as you reach the door. You are pinned down and wounded.

[[Try to open the door while under fire.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-Wounded]]

:: Ending-Turret
The old world's automated guardians perform their duty without remorse. Your journey ends at the vault's threshold.
:: GeoCoreVaultInner-WithMoth
The maintenance shaft leads to a small control room. Through a window, you see the third fragment on a pedestal in the main chamber. An old man is tending to machinery nearby.

[[Open the door to the main chamber.->GeoCoreVaultChamber-MetOren]]

:: GeoCoreVaultDoor-Safe
[[Enter the vault.->GeoCoreVaultChamber-MetOren]]
:: GeoCoreVaultDoor-Wounded
You manage to pry the door open a crack and slip inside, collapsing as the turrets cease firing. The old man, Dr. Oren Vale, looks down at you with pity.

[[Pass out from the pain.->GeoCoreVaultChamber-Wounded]]

:: GeoCoreVaultChamber-MetOren
Dr. Vale is frail but sharp-eyed. "Haven-0 is real," he says. "But it is not a savior. It is a choice. A final test for humanity." He gestures to the fragment. "Take it. The fourth is with me. Together, they lead to the arcology."

[[Take the third fragment.->GeoCoreVaultChamber-WithFragment3]]

:: GeoCoreVaultChamber-Wounded
Dr. Vale tends to your wound. When you awake, he explains everything. He holds the fourth fragment. "The path to Haven-0 is open. But who will walk it, and to what end?"

[[Recover and prepare for the final journey.->Haven0Approach-WithOren]]

:: GeoCoreVaultChamber-WithFragment3
You hold three fragments. Dr. Vale produces the fourth. "I will accompany you. The world must see this through." The complete map illuminates, showing the way to Haven-0.

[[Lead the way to Haven-0.->Haven0Approach-WithOren]]

:: Haven0Approach-WithOren
The path ends at a massive door. Dr. Vale places the final fragment into a slot. The door grinds open, revealing a pristine interior. The choice of what happens now is yours alone.

[[Enter Haven-0.->Haven0ControlRoom-FinalChoice]]

:: Haven0Approach-WithOren
The path ends at a massive door. Dr. Vale places the final fragment into a slot. The door grinds open, revealing a pristine interior. The choice of what happens now is yours alone.

[[Enter Haven-0.->Haven0ControlRoom-FinalChoice]]

:: Haven0Entrance-Convergence
Captain Hale, Union technicians, and Choir fanatics all demand entry. Dr. Vale looks to you. "Who do we let in? The fate of the world hinges on this decision."

[[Allow only the Technic Union inside.->Haven0ControlRoom-UnionOnly]]
[[Allow the Steel Legion to secure the facility.->Haven0ControlRoom-LegionOnly]]
[[Allow everyone inside to decide together.->Haven0ControlRoom-AllInside]]

:: Haven0ControlRoom-UnionOnly
[[Enter the control room.->Haven0ControlRoom-FinalChoice]]
:: Ending-Technocratic
The Technic Union activates Haven-0. The skies slowly clear, but a new age of strict technological governance begins. Order is restored, but freedom is a memory.

:: Haven0ControlRoom-LegionOnly
[[Enter the control room.->Haven0ControlRoom-FinalChoice]]
:: Ending-Dominion
You seize control of Haven-0. You dictate the terms of the new world. The purifier cleanses the lands of your allies and poisons the lands of your enemies. You are the new ruler of the ashes, a god of a broken world.

:: Ending-Chaos
Haven-0 explodes in a chain reaction, creating a new, permanent ashfall. Your attempt at unity resulted in the final end of hope.

:: Ending-Dominion
You seize control of Haven-0. You dictate the terms of the new world. The purifier cleanses the lands of your allies and poisons the lands of your enemies. You are the new ruler of the ashes, a god of a broken world.

:: Ending-Nomad
You overload the core. Haven-0 shudders and collapses in on itself, becoming a tomb for a dream too dangerous for mankind. The wasteland remains, but it is free. There are no more gods, no more masters. Only the road ahead.

:: Ending-Ashen
You shut down the system and seal the door. The ash is not a curse; it is a testament. It is the world humanity earned. You leave Haven-0 behind, returning to the wastes, content in the silent, grey truth.
:: NomadCaravan-LegionThreat
Your Legion squad approaches the Nomad caravans with hostility. The elders meet you at the perimeter, their faces grim. Moth stands with them, their hopeful expression replaced by betrayal. Captain Hale's orders are clear: take the fragment by any means necessary.

[[Demand the fragment.->NomadCaravan-LegionDemand]]
[[Attack without warning.->NomadCaravan-LegionAttack]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-WithLyraWounded
Lyra leans against a wall, clutching a bleeding wound from the fight. "I'll be fine," she insists, though her face is pale. The second fragment is in your hand. You need to get her to safety before pursuing the third.

[[Prioritize Lyra's safety and leave the spire.->SkybreakerExterior-WithLyraWounded]]
[[Press on into the deeper levels, helping Lyra along.->SkybreakerSublevel3-WithLyraWounded]]
:: NomadCaravan-LegionAttack
The attack is swift and brutal. The Nomads are overwhelmed. You secure their fragment, but Moth looks at you with utter betrayal. You now have two fragments, but you have lost something more.

[[Head for the Skybreaker spire with the second fragment.->SkybreakerApproach-Alone-Fragment2]]
:: NomadCaravan-LegionDemand
You issue Captain Hale's ultimatum. The elders refuse, standing firm. Moth steps forward, pleading with you to remember your humanity. Your squad grows restless, fingers on triggers. The situation is a powder keg.

[[Give the order to attack.->NomadCaravan-LegionAttack]]
[[Stand down and disobey Hale's orders.->NomadCaravan-LegionBetrayal]]

:: SkybreakerExterior-WithLyraWounded
You help Lyra out of the spire and into the ashen daylight. You find a ruined outbuilding to shelter in. She rests while you guard the entrance. After a day, her strength returns. The third fragment still awaits in the GeoCore Vault.

[[Continue the journey to the vault with a recovered Lyra.->ForbiddenZone-WithLyra]]
[[Travel to the vault alone, leaving Lyra to recover fully.->ForbiddenZone-Approach]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel3-WithLyraWounded
Supporting Lyra, you descend deeper. The air grows colder. You find a storage room with old medical supplies. You patch up Lyra's wound as best you can. The way forward is blocked by a collapsed corridor. The third fragment is beyond your reach here.

[[Retreat to the surface to recover.->SkybreakerExterior-WithLyraWounded]]
[[Search for an alternative path through the collapse.->SkybreakerSublevel3-CollapseSearch]]
:: SkybreakerSublevel3-CollapseSearch
You clear debris from a ventilation shaft barely wide enough to squeeze through. Lyra stays behind, guarding your exit. The shaft leads to a small chamber containing the third fragment, left by scavengers long ago. You take it and return to Lyra.

[[Emerge from the spire with the third fragment.->SkybreakerExterior-WithLyraAndFragment3]]
:: SkybreakerExterior-WithLyraAndFragment3
You and Lyra stand outside the spire, the third map fragment secure. The data points clearly to the GeoCore Vault. Lyra studies the horizon. "The final piece. I fear what we will become when we hold the key to the world's fate."

[[Begin the trek to the Forbidden Zone.->ForbiddenZone-WithLyra]]

:: SkybreakerApproach-Fragment1
You have the first fragment. The entrance to the Skybreaker spire lies ahead.

[[Enter the sublevels.->SkybreakerSublevel1-Fragment1]]
:: SkybreakerSublevel1-Fragment1
The sublevel is dark. Corridors branch off into darkness. A low hum vibrates through the floor. You have the first fragment.

[[Follow the humming sound.->SkybreakerSublevel2-Fragment1]]
[[Search a side corridor for the fragment.->SkybreakerArchive-Fragment1]]
:: SkybreakerArchive-Fragment1
You search the archive room. Among the crumbling records, you find a data chip containing the location of the second fragment, confirming it is in the main shrine chamber.

:: Haven0ControlRoom-AllInside
[[Enter the control room.->Haven0ControlRoom-FinalChoice]]

:: Haven0ControlRoom-AloneWithVale
The heavy door seals behind you and Dr. Vale. The control room is silent, a haven of clean air and humming machinery. Vale walks to the main console. "No armies, no factions. Just us. The choice is pure now. What is your will, Wanderer?"

[[Activate the purifier for restoration.->Ending-Restoration]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel2-Fragment2
The humming grows louder. You enter a large chamber filled with ancient machinery. The console where the second fragment rested is dark. You have only your own fragment.

[[Search for a way to the GeoCore Vault.->SkybreakerSublevel3-TransitDiscovered]]
:: SkybreakerShrine-Stealth-Alone
You move along the shadows of the machinery. You are almost to the console when a cultist spots you and raises the alarm.
[[Grab the fragment and run.->SkybreakerShrine-GrabAndRun-Alone]]
[[Stand your ground and fight.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone]]
:: SkybreakerShrine-Reason-Alone
You try to explain your quest. The cultists listen, unmoved. "The ash is purgation. You seek to undo it." They refuse to yield the fragment.

[[Attack them.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone]]
[[Leave the spire without the fragment.->SkybreakerExterior-NoFragment2]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-Wounded
You patch up your wounds. The second fragment is secure. The path to the third fragment lies ahead.

[[Try to pick the lock with a scrap of metal.->LegionCell-EscapeAttempt-NoFragment]]
[[Convince the sympathetic guard to help.->LegionCell-GuardAlliance-NoFragment]]

:: Ending-Restoration
The atmospheric purifier engages with a deep, resonant hum that vibrates through the very bones of the earth. Across the globe, the great machines of Haven-0 work their miracle. The oppressive grey ceiling of ash begins to fracture. For the first time in a century, a clean blue sky emerges, revealing a forgotten sun. The long winter is over. The long, arduous healing begins.

:: SkybreakerShrine-Reason
You lower your weapon and speak of your quest for Haven-0, of a chance to heal the world. The lead cultist shakes her head, a sad smile on her lips. "The ash is not a plague to be cured. It is a divine judgment, a purification. You seek to erase a sacred truth." They stand firm, blocking the fragment.

[[Attack them.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight]]
[[Leave the spire without the fragment.->SkybreakerExterior-NoFragment2]]
:: SkybreakerSublevel3-Fragment2
You find a data terminal still flickering with residual power. Accessing it, you download schematics that reveal a hidden transit line leading directly to the GeoCore Vault. The path is clear, but the tunnel is marked with warnings of structural decay and automated defenses.

[[Take the transit line to the vault.->ForbiddenZone-TransitRoute]]

[[Take the transit line to the vault.->ForbiddenZone-TransitRoute]]
:: NomadCaravan-Spotted-Fragment1
The Nomad caravans are a colorful mosaic of wind-sails and repurposed vehicles. They are wary of outsiders. They have heard of your encounter with the Legion and are suspicious. The fragment in your pack feels conspicuous.

[[Try to gain their trust.->NomadCaravan-Suspicious-Fragment1]]
[[Leave the caravan and continue alone.->WastelandCrossroads-Fragment1]]

You dart between rock formations. The Legion gives only a half-hearted chase. You escape easily. You have no map fragment.
[[Push on toward Skybreaker.->SkybreakerApproach-NoFragment]]

At the crossroads, Moth stands beside you. "So, where to now, partner?" The path ahead is uncertain, but you are not alone. The map points toward the GeoCore Vault, a legend of danger. The first fragment is in your pack.
[[Head for the vault with Moth.->ForbiddenZone-MothRoute]]
:: SkybreakerArchive-Alone-Fragment2
You search the archive room. Dusty data-spools and decayed manuals line the shelves. You find nothing new; the second fragment in your pack is your only guide forward. The path to the third fragment lies in the deeper levels.

[[Return to the main corridor.->SkybreakerSublevel2-Alone-Fragment2]]

:: SkybreakerArchive-WithFragment2
You and Lyra search the archive room. Among the decaying records, she finds a schematic for the GeoCore Vault's security system. "This could be useful," she says. But it confirms the third fragment is not here.

[[Return to the main corridor.->SkybreakerSublevel2-WithFragment2]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel2-Alone-Fragment2

[[Leave without the scanner.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone-Fragment1]]

:: BadlandsCanyon-EscapeAttempt-Alone-Fragment1
You dart between rock formations, clutching your pack. The shouts of the Legion fade behind you. You escape the patrol, the precious fragment still safe.
[[Push on toward Skybreaker.->SkybreakerApproach-Alone-Fragment1]]

:: BadlandsCanyon-Alone-NoFragment
A Legion patrol spots you. "Halt! By order of Captain Hale!" They raise their rifles. They seem less interested in you, a drifter with no apparent valuables.

[[Surrender.->SteelLegionCamp-Captured-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Try to run and hide.->BadlandsCanyon-EscapeAttempt-Alone-NoFragment]]
:: BadlandsCanyon-EscapeAttempt-Alone-NoFragment
You dart between rock formations. The Legion gives only a half-hearted chase. You escape easily. You have no map fragment.
[[Push on toward Skybreaker.->SkybreakerApproach-Alone-NoFragment]]
:: SkybreakerApproach-Alone-NoFragment
You reach the spire alone. The entrance hatch is rusted shut. It will take time and noise to force it open. You have no fragments to guide you, only a fading hope.
[[Force the hatch open.->SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Turn away, accepting the futility of the quest.->Ending-Vermin]]
:: SkybreakerApproach-Alone-WithScanner

:: SkybreakerShrine-Confrontation-Alone-Fragment1
The cultists turn, their eyes wide with fervor. "You would defy the sacred ash!" they cry. They attack without warning.
[[Fight your way to the fragment.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone-Fragment1]]
[[Try to reason with them.->SkybreakerShrine-Reason-Alone-Fragment1]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-Stealth-Alone-Fragment1
You move along the shadows of the machinery. You are almost to the console when a cultist spots you and raises the alarm.
[[Grab the fragment and run.->SkybreakerShrine-GrabAndRun-Alone-Fragment1]]
[[Stand your ground and fight.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone-Fragment1]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-Reason-Alone-Fragment1
You try to explain your quest. The cultists listen, unmoved. "The ash is purgation. You seek to undo it." They refuse to yield the fragment.

[[Attack them.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone-Fragment1]]
[[Leave the spire without the fragment.->SkybreakerExterior-Alone-NoFragment2]]
:: SkybreakerShrine-Wounded-Alone-Fragment1
You patch up your wounds. The second fragment is secure. The path to the third fragment lies ahead.
[[Continue the journey.->ForbiddenZone-Approach-Alone]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-NoFragment
The sublevel is dark. Corridors branch off into darkness. A low hum vibrates through the floor. You search blindly for any clue.
[[Follow the humming sound.->SkybreakerSublevel2-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Search a side corridor.->SkybreakerArchive-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel2-Alone-NoFragment
The humming grows louder. You enter a large chamber filled with ancient machinery. The console is dark and empty. The Ashen Choir stands guard over nothing. They turn to you, their eyes burning with fervor.
[[Confront the cultists.->SkybreakerShrine-Confrontation-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Attempt to sneak past.->SkybreakerShrine-Stealth-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-Confrontation-Alone-NoFragment

[[Fight your way through.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Try to reason with them.->SkybreakerShrine-Reason-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-Stealth-Alone-NoFragment
You move along the shadows of the machinery. The cultists are vigilant, and they spot you almost immediately.
[[Fight your way out.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Retreat from the spire.->SkybreakerExterior-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone-NoFragment
The fight is brutal. You overcome the cultists, but you are wounded. The chamber holds no reward for you.
[[Tend to your wounds and leave.->SkybreakerExterior-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-Reason-Alone-NoFragment
You try to explain your quest. The cultists listen, unmoved. "You seek emptiness. The ash is fullness." They block your path.
[[Attack them.->SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Leave the spire.->SkybreakerExterior-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: SkybreakerExterior-Alone-NoFragment
You emerge from the spire into the ashen daylight, empty-handed. The quest for the fragments feels hopeless. The GeoCore Vault is a distant, dangerous dream.
[[Abandon the quest and wander the wastes.->Ending-Vermin]]
[[Search for other leads.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-WithScanner
The sublevel is dark. The scanner reveals a faint energy signature leading deeper into the spire. It guides you past unstable corridors toward a large chamber. A low hum vibrates through the floor.
[[Follow the scanner's signal.->SkybreakerSublevel2-Alone-WithScanner]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel2-Alone-WithScanner
The humming grows louder. You enter a large chamber filled with ancient machinery. In the center, on a console, glows the second map fragment. But the room is occupied by figures in grey robes—the Ashen Choir. You are alone.
[[Confront the cultists.->SkybreakerShrine-Confrontation-Alone-WithScanner]]
[[Attempt to sneak past them.->SkybreakerShrine-Stealth-Alone-WithScanner]]

:: SteelLegionCamp-Captured-Alone-NoFragment
You are disarmed and marched to the Legion camp. Captain Hale questions you but finds you have nothing of value. You are thrown into a cell.
[[Wait for an opportunity.->LegionCell-Captured-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: LegionCell-Captured-Alone-NoFragment
Days pass. The sympathetic guard, Elara, approaches your cell during a quiet night. "Hale is gone on a patrol. This is your only chance." She slips a key through the bars. "I can't give you back what you lost, but I can give you your freedom."

[[Take the key and escape.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone-NoFragment]]
:: LegionCell-EscapeAttempt-Alone-NoFragment
You work at the lock for hours. Finally, it clicks open. You slip out into the quiet camp under the cover of night.
[[Escape without the fragment.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: LegionCell-GuardAlliance-Alone-NoFragment
The guard, named Elara, whispers, "I hate what the Legion has become." She slips you a key. "Your gear is gone. Go, before Hale returns."
[[Follow Elara's directions out.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: ForbiddenZone-Approach-Alone
The GeoCore Vault door is a massive slab of reinforced alloy. Automated turrets sweep the approach. You have the second fragment, but you are alone.
[[Attempt to disable the turrets.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-Alone-DisableTurrets]]
[[Make a desperate dash for the door.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-Alone-Dash]]

:: AshRavine-LyraTechnomancy
"It's a storm-predictor," Lyra says. "Old tech, modified. The Union exiled me for 'unorthodox research'." She studies you. "Your map fragment... it's part of something bigger. I've seen its energy signature before."

[[Offer to work together.->AshRavine-WithLyra]]
[[Thank her for the information and prepare to leave.->AshRavine-Alone]]

:: BadlandsCanyon-EscapeAttempt-Fragment1
You scramble up a scree slope, dislodging rocks that slow your pursuers. You find a narrow crevice and squeeze inside, holding your breath until the Legion patrol passes by, cursing. Your fragment is safe.
[[Continue toward the Skybreaker spire.->SkybreakerApproach-Alone-Fragment1]]
:: GeoCoreVaultDoor-Alone-Dash
You sprint across the open ground. The turrets whir to life. A shot grazes your arm, but you dive behind a rock outcrop near the door, wounded but alive. The door is within reach.

[[Try to force the door open while wounded.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-Wounded]]

:: GeoCoreVaultDoor-Alone-DisableTurrets
You spot a junction box for the turret system. Using your tools, you carefully reroute the power. The turrets power down with a low hum. The path to the vault door is now clear.

[[Approach the vault door.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-Alone]]

:: NomadCaravan-Rejected
The guards advance, their weapons raised. You are forced to retreat from the caravan perimeter, their warnings ringing in your ears. You have the first fragment, but no allies.
[[Head for the Skybreaker spire alone.->SkybreakerApproach-Alone-Fragment1]]
:: OutpostMarket-MetMoth
You help the courier steady the crate. "Thanks!" they say, brushing ash from their face. "I'm Moth. Not many folks stop to help around here." They glance at your pack with curious eyes.

[[Ask Moth about the area.->OutpostMarket-WithMoth]]
[[Nod and move on, looking for a bunk.->OutpostBunks-Alone]]

:: SkybreakerApproach-Alone-Fragment2
The spire looms ahead. You have the second fragment. The entrance hatch is still rusted, but the fragment's data suggests a safe path lies within.

[[Force the hatch open and enter.->SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-Fragment2]]

:: SkybreakerApproach-Fragment2
You have the second fragment. The spire is a dark silhouette against the grey sky. The data points deeper inside, toward the final fragments.

[[Enter the spire.->SkybreakerSublevel1-Fragment2]]

:: SkybreakerArchive-Alone-NoFragment
The archive room is a tomb of decaying data-spools and brittle paper. You find nothing of value. The second fragment is not here, and you have no leads.

[[Return to the main corridor.->SkybreakerSublevel2-Alone-NoFragment]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel2-Fragment1
The humming grows louder. You enter a large chamber filled with ancient machinery. In the center, on a console, glows the second map fragment. But the room is occupied by figures in grey robes—the Ashen Choir.

:: WastelandCrossroads-NoFragment
At a crossroads marked by a shattered signpost, you have a choice. You are alone and possess no map fragments. The main trade road leads to a Nomad gathering point. A worn path leads toward rumored Union bunkers. The direct route cuts through Legion-patrolled badlands.

[[Follow the path to the Technic Union.->UnionOutpost-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Risk the badlands for speed.->BadlandsCanyon-Alone-NoFragment]]
:: OutpostMarket-WithMoth
Moth leads you through the crowded market, pointing out hidden stalls and safe corners. "The Legion's been bullying traders," they whisper. "And the Nomads are nervous. Something about old maps." They stop by a quiet stall. "You look like you're going somewhere important. Need a guide?"

[[Accept Moth's offer of guidance.->NomadCaravan-WithMoth]]
[[Politely decline and go your own way.->OutpostBunks-Alone]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel1-Fragment2
The sublevel is dark. Corridors branch off into darkness. A low hum vibrates through the floor. You hold the second map fragment. Its faint glow illuminates the immediate area, revealing scuffmarks on the floor leading deeper into the complex.

[[Follow the scuffmarks toward the humming.->SkybreakerSublevel2-Fragment2]]
[[Search a side corridor for more clues.->SkybreakerArchive-Fragment2]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-Fragment2

[[Regroup and plan your next move.->SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-Fragment2]]
:: SkybreakerShrine-Fight-Alone-Fragment1
The fight is brutal. You overcome the cultists. The second fragment is yours, but you are wounded.

[[Take the fragment and press on.->SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-Fragment2]]
:: AshRavine-Alone
You keep to the shadows, watching the stranger from a distance. She eventually packs her device and leaves through a different passage as the storm subsides. You are alone in the cave.

[[Continue your journey at dawn.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone]]

:: ForbiddenZone-TransitRoute
The transit tunnel is dark and strewn with debris. Your footsteps echo ominously. Ahead, a flickering light reveals a maintenance drone, its programming corrupted. It turns toward you, tools whirring aggressively.

[[Attempt to disable the drone.->ForbiddenZone-TransitRoute-DroneDisabled]]
[[Sprint past the drone toward the vault door.->ForbiddenZone-TransitRoute-Dash]]

:: LegionArmory-Escape
You find your gear in the armory, exactly where Elara said it would be. Your map fragment is safe. You slip out a side exit into the night, leaving the Legion camp behind.
[[Head for the Skybreaker spire.->SkybreakerApproach-Alone-Fragment1]]
:: LegionCell-EscapeAttempt
You work at the lock with a scrap of metal for what feels like hours. Finally, it clicks open. You slip out into the quiet camp, your fragment lost to Hale.
[[Escape the camp.->WastelandCrossroads-LostFragment]]

[[Escape the camp.->WastelandCrossroads-NoFragment]]

:: LegionCell-GuardAlliance-NoFragment

[[Escape into the wastes.->WastelandCrossroads-NoFragment]]

:: NomadCaravan-Alone
The caravan is a bustling cluster of wagons and tents. Without Moth to vouch for you, the Nomads regard you with silent suspicion. You feel like an outsider.

[[Try to speak with the elders.->NomadCaravan-Suspicious-Alone]]
[[Leave the caravan and continue alone.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone]]

:: NomadCaravan-LegionBetrayal
You lower your weapon and face your squad. "We're leaving." The Legion soldiers stare in disbelief, but they obey. As you retreat, you see the relief on the Nomads' faces, and the dawning respect in Moth's eyes. You are now a traitor to the Legion.
[[Leave with the Nomads.->NomadCaravan-WithMoth-LegionBetrayal]]
[[Leave alone, an enemy of both factions.->WastelandCrossroads-LegionBetrayal]]
:: SkybreakerArchive-Fragment2
You search the archive room. Among the decaying records, you find only corrupted data-spools. The second fragment in your possession is your only guide. The path forward lies elsewhere.

[[Return to the main corridor.->SkybreakerSublevel2-Fragment2]]

:: SkybreakerExterior-Alone-NoFragment2
You emerge from the spire into the ashen daylight, wounded and empty-handed. The second fragment remains with the cult. The quest seems impossible.
[[Search for another way to the GeoCore Vault.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone-NoFragment]]
:: SkybreakerExterior-NoFragment
You leave the spire, the cultists' cries fading behind you. You failed to secure the second fragment. The GeoCore Vault is a distant dream.

The fight is swift and brutal. You are outnumbered. A cultist's blade finds its mark. The world fades to black.

[[->Ending-Vermin]]

:: SkybreakerShrine-GrabAndRun-Alone
You snatch the fragment from the console and sprint for the exit. The cultists give chase, their cries echoing through the corridors. You manage to lose them in the maze-like sublevels.

[[Regroup and plan your next move.->SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-Fragment2-New]]
:: SkybreakerShrine-Stealth-Alone-WithScanner
You move along the shadows of the machinery. The scanner helps you avoid patrols. You reach the console and take the second fragment without being seen.
[[Escape the chamber silently.->SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-Fragment2]]
:: SteelLegionCamp-Captured-Alone-Fragment1
You are disarmed and marched to the Legion camp. Captain Hale confiscates your fragment. "A waste of potential," he says. You are thrown into a cell.

[[Wait for an opportunity.->LegionCell-Captured-NoFragment]]

:: UnionOutpost-Alone
The Technic Union outpost is a blast door set into a hillside. You are scanned before entry. Inside, technicians in clean robes murmur over consoles. They are wary but not hostile.
[[Ask about the map fragments.->UnionOutpost-Alone-Fragment1]]
[[Leave without engaging.->WastelandCrossroads-Alone-NoFragment]]
:: WastelandCrossroads-Fragment1
At a crossroads marked by a shattered signpost, you stand alone. The first map fragment is a heavy secret in your pack. Paths lead to different factions, each with its own dangers.

[[Follow the path to the Technic Union.->UnionOutpost-Alone-Fragment1]]
[[Risk the badlands for speed.->BadlandsCanyon-Alone-Fragment1]]
:: ForbiddenZone-TransitRoute-Dash
You sprint past the drone, your boots crunching on debris. A spinning blade grazes your leg, but you keep running. The vault door is ahead, sealed and imposing. The drone deactivates, its patrol radius limited. You are at the threshold, wounded but determined.

[[Attempt to open the vault door.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-Wounded]]

:: ForbiddenZone-TransitRoute-DroneDisabled
You dismantle the drone's power core with a well-aimed strike. It clatters to the ground, inert. The path ahead is clear. The massive vault door stands unguarded at the end of the transit tunnel.

[[Approach the vault door.->GeoCoreVaultDoor-Safe]]

:: WastelandCrossroads-LegionBetrayal
At a crossroads marked by a shattered signpost, you stand alone, branded a traitor by the Steel Legion. The Nomads offered sanctuary, but you chose solitude. The wind howls across the plain. Paths lead toward the Technic Union or through the dangerous badlands.

You patch up your wounds. The second fragment is secure. The path to the third fragment lies ahead.

[[Continue the journey.->ForbiddenZone-Approach-Alone]]

:: WastelandCrossroads-LostFragment
At a crossroads marked by a shattered signpost, you are utterly alone. The Legion has your fragment. The wind howls across the plain. Paths lead toward the Nomads, the Union, or through Legion territory.

Days pass. The sympathetic guard, Elara, approaches your cell during a quiet night. "Hale is gone on a patrol. This is your only chance." She slips a key through the bars.

[[Take the key and escape.->WastelandCrossroads-LostFragment]]

:: SkybreakerSublevel1-Alone-Fragment2-New

[[Search a side corridor.->SkybreakerArchive-Alone-Fragment2]]

:: BadlandsCanyon-EscapeAttempt-LegionBetrayal
You flee into the labyrinthine canyon, the shouts of your former comrades echoing behind you. They hunt with purpose, their anger making them relentless. You find a crevice and hide, listening as they search the area. After a tense hour, they move on, convinced you have escaped deeper into the wastes.

[[Push on toward the Skybreaker spire out of desperation.->SkybreakerApproach-Alone-NoFragment]]
:: NomadCaravan-Suspicious-LostFragment
The elders listen to your story of losing the fragment to the Legion. Their faces show pity, but no trust. "Without the map, you are just another soul adrift," one says. They offer you a meal for the night but refuse you permanent sanctuary.

[[Accept the meal and leave at dawn.->WastelandCrossroads-LostFragment]]
[[Leave immediately.->WastelandCrossroads-LostFragment]]

:: SteelLegionCamp-Captured-Traitor
You are dragged before Captain Hale. His face is a mask of cold fury. "Betrayal is the only unforgivable sin," he says. There is no cell this time, only a swift and final judgment.

[[->Ending-Betrayal]]

:: UnionOutpost-LegionBetrayal-Plea
You explain your defiance of the Legion, your belief in a different path. The Union technicians listen impassively. "Your story is compelling," one admits. "But without a fragment, you offer only risk. We cannot shelter you."

[[Leave the outpost.->WastelandCrossroads-LegionBetrayal]]

:: WastelandCrossroads-Alone
At a crossroads marked by a shattered signpost, you stand utterly alone. The wind whips ash into tiny cyclones. Paths lead toward the Nomads, the Technic Union, or through the treacherous badlands. Your journey is yours to define.

[[Head toward the Skybreaker spire out of habit.->SkybreakerApproach-Alone-NoFragment]]
[[Search the badlands for salvage, abandoning the quest.->Ending-Vermin]]

:: NomadCaravan-WithMoth-LegionBetrayal
Moth walks with you as you leave the caravan perimeter. "That took guts," they say. "The elders respect your choice. You're welcome with us, for now." You have an ally, but the Legion is your enemy.
[[Set out for the Skybreaker spire with Moth.->SkybreakerApproach-WithMoth-LegionBetrayal]]
