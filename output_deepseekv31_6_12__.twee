::Start
Ashfall: Roads of Ruin. The ash drifts down, a constant grey snow. You clutch a singed piece of plastic-coated paper—your map fragment. Your journey begins at the Rusted Bus, a known shelter on the edge of the Blasted Flats.
[[Scout the perimeter->RustedBus-Perimeter]]
[[Search the bus interior->RustedBus-Interior]]

::RustedBus-Perimeter
You circle the derelict bus. Tracks in the ash—recent, many of them. Raiders. A low rumble echoes from the north. An ash storm is coming. Fast.
[[Get inside the bus->RustedBus-Interior]]
[[Head for the rock outcrop->RockOutcrop-AshStorm]]

::RustedBus-Interior
Inside the bus, you find scant shelter. A glint catches your eye: a half-empty canteen under a seat. The storm hits, howling against the metal shell. You wait it out.
[[After the storm, move out->BlastedFlats-AfterStorm]]

::RockOutcrop-AshStorm
You sprint to the rocks as the sky turns black. Huddled in a crevice, you see a figure approaching through the swirling ash—a young woman with a scarf wrapped tight.
[[Signal to her->RockOutcrop-MetMoth]]
[[Stay hidden->RockOutcrop-Alone]]

::RockOutcrop-MetMoth
She scrambles into the crevice. "Name's Moth. Courier. Not a good day for travel." She shares a piece of dried fruit. "Seen raider sign back there. You heading east?"
[[Travel with Moth->BlastedFlats-WithMoth]]
[[Thank her but go alone->BlastedFlats-AfterStorm]]

::RockOutcrop-Alone
You remain silent. The figure passes by, unseen. The storm rages for an hour before subsiding. You are alone again.
[[Continue east->BlastedFlats-AfterStorm]]

::BlastedFlats-AfterStorm
The flats are eerily calm after the storm. The air is thick with settled dust. To the east, the silhouette of a settlement, Mercy's End, breaks the horizon.
[[Approach Mercy's End->MercyEnd-Gate]]

::BlastedFlats-WithMoth
Moth leads the way, picking a path through the ash. "Mercy's End is up ahead. They're wary, but they'll trade for clean water. I've got a delivery there." She points. "The Legion was sniffing around last week. Be careful."
[[Enter Mercy's End with Moth->MercyEnd-Gate-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-Gate
The settlement gates are heavy scrap metal. A guard atop the wall shouts down, "State your business! And show your hands!"
[[Claim to be a scavenger->MercyEnd-Gate-Scavenger]]
[[Say you have information to trade->MercyEnd-Gate-Informer]]

::MercyEnd-Gate-WithMoth
Moth waves at the guard. "Jax! It's Moth! Package for the elder." The gate creaks open slightly. Jax nods at you. "Vouched for by Moth? Enter. But cause no trouble."
[[Enter the settlement->MercyEnd-Market-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-Gate-Scavenger
"Scavenger, eh? What'd you find?" You show a few trinkets. The gate opens. "Don't linger long."
[[Enter the settlement->MercyEnd-Market]]

::MercyEnd-Gate-Informer
"Information is cheap. Prove its value." You mention the raider tracks near the bus. The guard considers this. "Useful enough. Enter. But stay out of trouble."
[[Enter the settlement->MercyEnd-Market]]
::MercyEnd-Market
The market is a crowded maze of stalls under patchwork awnings. The air smells of cooked fungus and dust. A commotion draws your eye—a Steel Legion patrol is questioning a merchant roughly.
[[Observe the Legion patrol->MercyEnd-LegionPatrol]]
[[Slip away to the quieter alleys->MercyEnd-Alleys]]

::MercyEnd-Market-WithMoth
Moth leads you through the bustling market. "My contact is near the well." She points. A Legion patrol moves through the crowd, causing uneasy whispers. Moth ducks behind a stall, pulling you with her. "Trouble. They're looking for someone."
[[Confront the Legion->MercyEnd-LegionConfront-WithMoth]]
[[Hide with Moth->MercyEnd-Hide-WithMoth]]
::MercyEnd-Alleys
You slip into a narrow alley between two leaning shacks. The noise of the market fades. A rustling comes from a pile of scrap ahead. A gaunt man emerges, clutching a shiv. "Your supplies. Now." He lunges.
[[Fight back->MercyEnd-AlleyFight]]
[[Try to reason->MercyEnd-AlleyReason]]

::MercyEnd-Hide-WithMoth
Moth pulls you into a shadowy niche behind a water barrel. The Legion soldiers pass, their boots scraping on the packed earth. "They're hunting a technomancer," Moth whispers. "An exile named Lyra. They think she's here."
[[Search for Lyra->MercyEnd-LyraSearch-WithMoth]]
[[Leave the settlement quickly->MercyEnd-GateExit-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-LegionConfront-WithMoth
You step out in front of the patrol. Their leader, a woman with a scarred face, eyes you. "You. Have you seen an exile? Red hair, wears a broken data-bracelet." Moth tenses beside you.
[[Deny seeing Lyra->MercyEnd-LegionDeny-WithMoth]]
[[Divert them with a false lead->MercyEnd-LegionDivert-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-LegionPatrol
The Legion sergeant shoves the merchant against his stall. "Where is the tech-runner? Your lies endanger this entire settlement." He draws a stun baton. The crowd watches, silent and fearful.
[[Intervene on the merchant's behalf->MercyEnd-Intervene]]
[[Remain in the crowd->MercyEnd-Crowd]]
::MercyEnd-AlleyFight
You sidestep the lunge and grab his arm, twisting the shiv from his grasp. He collapses, coughing. "Please... ash-take me." He has nothing of value.
[[Continue to the market->MercyEnd-Market]]

::MercyEnd-AlleyReason
"I have no supplies to spare," you say, keeping your hands visible. The man lowers his shiv, despair in his eyes. "The Legion took everything. Just leave." He retreats into the shadows.
[[Return to the market->MercyEnd-Market]]

::MercyEnd-Crowd
You watch as the merchant breaks and gives a name. The Legion soldiers drag him away. The market returns to a tense normalcy. You feel eyes on you.
[[Leave the market->MercyEnd-GateExit]]
[[Search for information about the exile->MercyEnd-LyraRumors]]

::MercyEnd-GateExit-WithMoth
Moth leads you to a small, unguarded postern gate. "This way. The Legion is too focused on the main square." You slip out into the ash fields beyond the walls.
[[Travel toward the highlands->HighlandsTrail-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-Intervene
"Enough," you say, stepping forward. The sergeant turns, amused. "A volunteer for questioning? Take them too." Two soldiers grab your arms.
[[Resist arrest->MercyEnd-ArrestFight]]
[[Go quietly->MercyEnd-LegionHold]]

::MercyEnd-LegionDeny-WithMoth
"We've seen no one," you state flatly. The sergeant's eyes narrow, but she nods. "Move along. And report any suspicious activity to the Legion." The patrol moves on.
[[Continue with Moth to her contact->MercyEnd-Well-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-LegionDivert-WithMoth
"I saw a red-haired woman near the eastern wall," you lie. The sergeant barks an order and the patrol hurries away. Moth lets out a held breath. "That was risky."
[[Head to the well to meet Moth's contact->MercyEnd-Well-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-LyraSearch-WithMoth
You and Moth search the back alleys. Behind a faded tapestry, you find a hidden door. Inside, a woman with red hair is bent over a sparking console. She looks up, alarmed. "Who sent you?"
[[Say Moth sent you->MercyEnd-LyraMet-WithMoth]]
[[Claim to be a friend->MercyEnd-LyraMet-WithMoth]]
::HighlandsTrail-WithMoth
The trail climbs into rocky highlands, offering a view of the bleak expanse below. Moth points to a distant plume of smoke. "Union outpost. They might know about your map fragment. Legion avoids the high ground—ash winds are too tricky here." A low whine echoes from a crevice—a damaged drone lies half-buried.
[[Investigate the drone->HighlandsTrail-Drone-WithMoth]]
[[Head for the Union outpost->UnionOutpost-Gate-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-ArrestFight
You struggle against the soldiers, but more swarm you. A rifle butt strikes your head. Darkness swallows you. You awake in a dim holding cell, your possessions gone.
[[Wait for interrogation->MercyEnd-LegionCell]]

:: MercyEnd-GateExit
[[Head east toward the mountains->BlastedFlats-AfterStorm]]
::MercyEnd-LegionHold
You are marched to a fortified building and thrown into a cell. Hours pass. The door opens. Captain Bronn Hale stands there, holding your map fragment. "This is Legion property now. Your cooperation may earn you a quick death."
[[Attempt to bargain->MercyEnd-Bargain]]
[[Remain silent->MercyEnd-Silence]]

::MercyEnd-LyraMet-WithMoth
Lyra Kade studies you. "Moth? Good. The Legion is hunting me because I decrypted part of a Haven-0 fragment. Your map is useless without the cipher." She gestures to her console. "Help me escape Mercy's End, and I'll help you."
[[Agree to help Lyra->MercyEnd-LyraEscape-WithMoth]]
[[Refuse and leave->MercyEnd-Well-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-LyraRumors
You ask discreetly about the exile. A washerwoman whispers, "She hides near the old well. But the Legion pays well for traitors." You feel a tap on your shoulder—a Legion informant smiles coldly.
[[Run for the well->MercyEnd-Well-Alone]]
[[Confront the informant->MercyEnd-Informant]]

::MercyEnd-Well-WithMoth
At the well, an elderly man accepts Moth's package. "The elder thanks you." He glances at you. "Stranger, the Dustborn travel to the Sunken Library soon. They seek old knowledge. Perhaps your map leads there." He offers a small token of safe passage.
[[Accept the token and leave->MercyEnd-GateExit-WithMoth-Token]]
[[Decline and seek other leads->MercyEnd-Market-WithMoth]]
::BadlandsTrail-LyraSighting
You follow the figure into the jagged badlands. The ash is deep here, swallowing sound. Up ahead, the red-haired woman pauses by a rock formation, scanning the horizon. She hasn't noticed you yet.
[[Approach cautiously->BadlandsTrail-LyraMet]]
[[Observe from a distance->BadlandsTrail-LyraObserved]]

::HighlandsTrail-Drone-WithMoth
You and Moth dig the drone out. Its lights flicker. Moth examines it. "Union tech. It's a scout—badly damaged." A holoprojector sputters to life, displaying a partial map of the highlands. One symbol matches your fragment: a ruin labeled "Sunken Library."
[[Take the drone's core->HighlandsTrail-WithMoth-HasDroneCore]]
[[Leave it and continue->UnionOutpost-Gate-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-Bargain
"I know where the other exiles are," you bluff. Captain Hale laughs. "We have them all. But you... you have a certain resilience. Serve the Legion. Hunt the Dustborn courier, Moth. Then we'll talk about your map."
[[Agree to serve->MercyEnd-LegionRecruit]]
[[Refuse->MercyEnd-Silence]]

::MercyEnd-GateExit-WithMoth-Token
Moth leads you out, the elder's token warm in your hand. "The Sunken Library is a dangerous trek," she says. "But this token will get us past the Nomad sentinels. We need supplies first."
[[Travel to the Nomad rendezvous->NomadRendezvous-WithMoth-Token]]
[[Detour to scavenge for gear->ScavengerRuin-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-Informant
You turn to face the informant, a lean man with a Legion badge. "Curious about the ashwitch?" he sneers. "The Captain would reward you handsomely for her location." His hand rests on his pistol.
[[Lead him to the well->MercyEnd-Well-Betrayal]]
[[Attack him->MercyEnd-AlleyFight-Informant]]

::MercyEnd-LegionCell
The cell is cold and damp. Through the barred window, you hear the settlement's dull routine. A guard slides a plate of gruel under the door. "Hale decides your fate at dawn."
[[Try to pick the lock->MercyEnd-CellEscape]]
[[Wait for Hale->MercyEnd-HaleVisit]]

::MercyEnd-Silence
You say nothing. Captain Hale's smile vanishes. "A waste of resolve." He nods to a guard. The stun baton crackles. Your world goes black.
[[Wake in the ash->MercyEnd-Exile]]

::MercyEnd-Well-Alone
You run to the old well. The area is deserted. A hidden panel lies open near the base, leading down into darkness. Footsteps approach from behind—heavy, booted steps.
[[Descend into the well->MercyEnd-WellHide]]
[[Face the pursuers->MercyEnd-LegionAmbush]]

::MountainPass-Alone
The mountain pass is steep and lonely. Wind whips ash into swirling devils. A crude totem stands at a fork in the path—skulls and feathers. The Ashen Choir marks its territory.
[[Take the left path, past the totem->MountainPass-ChoirTerritory]]
[[Take the right path, skirting the rocks->MountainPass-RockyTrail]]

:: UnionOutpost-Gate-WithMoth
[[Say you seek knowledge->UnionOutpost-Gate-Scholar-WithMoth]]
::BadlandsTrail-LyraMet
You step forward, hands open. Lyra spins, a spark of energy at her fingertips. "Easy," you say. "I mean no harm. I saw you at Mercy's End." She relaxes slightly. "The Legion dogs are persistent. You're alone? Foolish, but perhaps useful. I'm tracking a signal—a Haven-0 fragment. Your map is just the start."
[[Offer to help track the signal->BadlandsTrail-LyraMet-OfferHelp]]
[[Ask about the Legion's interest->BadlandsTrail-LyraMet-LegionInterest]]

::BadlandsTrail-LyraObserved
You stay hidden behind a boulder. Lyra consults a device on her wrist, then turns and climbs a steep path toward a metal hatch set into the hillside. She disappears inside. This is her hideout.
[[Approach the hatch now->BadlandsTrail-LyraHideout]]
[[Wait and watch->BadlandsTrail-LyraHideoutWait]]

::HighlandsTrail-WithMoth-HasDroneCore
You pry the core unit from the drone. It hums faintly. Moth stows it in her pack. "The Union will want this back. Or we could use its data." The path to the outpost continues upward, the ruined library symbol burning in your mind.
[[Proceed to the Union outpost->UnionOutpost-Gate-WithMoth-HasDroneCore]]
[[Detour toward the Sunken Library->HighlandsTrail-LibraryDetour-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-AlleyFight-Informant
You knock the informant's pistol aside and drive a knee into his gut. He gasps, dropping his weapon. Before you can finish him, a whistle pierces the alley—Legion reinforcements are coming. You must flee.
[[Run for the well->MercyEnd-Well-Alone]]
[[Escape through the market->MercyEnd-Market-Escape]]

::MercyEnd-CellEscape
You find a loose wire in the cot's frame. Painstakingly, you work it into the old lock. After an hour of scraping, the mechanism clicks. The door swings open silently. The hallway is empty.
[[Sneak toward the armory->MercyEnd-ArmorySneak]]
[[Head for the exterior walls->MercyEnd-WallEscape]]

::MercyEnd-Distraction-WithMoth-Lyra
You suggest starting a fire in a empty stall. Moth nods, creating a smokescreen with a chemical pellet. Alarms blare. As the Legion scrambles, Lyra pulls the grate open. "Now! While they're distracted!"
[[Enter the vent->MercyEnd-VentEscape-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::MercyEnd-Exile
You wake face-down in the ash, miles from Mercy's End. Your head throbs. Your map fragment is gone. All you have is the clothes on your back and a burning thirst. The settlement is a dark smudge on the horizon. Survival is all that remains.
[[Scavenge for water->BlastedFlats-ExileStart]]
[[Follow the tracks of a lone traveler->BlastedFlats-ExileFollow]]

::MercyEnd-HaleVisit
At dawn, Captain Hale enters your cell. "Last chance. Join the Legion's campaign. We are the only order left in this chaos. Refuse, and you will be made an example." He places a Legion badge on the bench.
[[Take the badge->MercyEnd-LegionRecruit]]
[[Spit on the badge->MercyEnd-Exile]]

::MercyEnd-LegionAmbush
You turn to face three Legion soldiers, their rifles raised. "The ashwitch. Where is she?" their leader demands. You raise your hands, knowing resistance is futile.
[[Surrender->MercyEnd-LegionHold]]
[[Attempt a desperate escape->MercyEnd-AlleyFight-Legion]]

::MercyEnd-LegionRecruit
You take the badge. Captain Hale smiles coldly. "Welcome to the Steel Legion. Your first duty: hunt down the courier Moth. She was seen with a map fragment. Bring her—and it—to me." You are given a rifle and a patrol route.
[[Begin the hunt->MercyEnd-MothHunt]]
[[Feign allegiance and plan escape->MercyEnd-FalseRecruit]]

::MercyEnd-VentEscape-WithMoth-Lyra
The vent is tight and dark, filled with the smell of rust. You crawl for what feels like an hour, Lyra leading the way. Light appears ahead. You emerge outside the walls, deep in a gully. The settlement's alarms are faint.
[[Regroup in the gully->MercyEnd-Gully-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Put distance between you and Mercy's End immediately->BadlandsTrail-WithMoth-Lyra]]
::MercyEnd-Well-Betrayal
"You'll get your reward," you tell the informant. You lead him to the well. As he peers down the hidden passage, you shove him hard. He falls with a cry. You hear a sickening crunch from below. The well is silent.
[[Descend into the well->MercyEnd-WellHide]]
[[Flee the scene->MercyEnd-GateExit]]

::MercyEnd-WellHide
You climb down a rusty ladder into a cistern. Flickering light comes from a makeshift shelter. Lyra is there, packing a bag. She looks up, startled. "You? How did you find me? The Legion is everywhere above."
[[Warn her about the informant->MercyEnd-WellHide-Warn]]
[[Ask for her help with the map->MercyEnd-WellHide-AskHelp]]

::MountainPass-ChoirTerritory
The path leads into a canyon painted with ash-symbols. Chanting echoes off the walls. Ahead, figures in grey robes circle a smoking pit. They haven't seen you yet. A narrow side passage offers a way around.
[[Observe the ritual->MountainPass-ChoirRitual]]
[[Sneak past using the side passage->MountainPass-ChoirSneak]]

::MountainPass-RockyTrail
The trail is treacherous, skirting a sheer drop. You find a safe perch to rest. Below, you see a Legion land-train moving through the valley. It's heading for a large facility—the Skybreaker ruins. They're mounting an assault.
[[Continue toward the mountains->MountainPass-Ascent]]
[[Change course to observe Skybreaker->MountainPass-SkybreakerView]]

::NomadRendezvous-WithMoth-Token
Moth leads you to a windswept plateau where Nomad sand-ships are anchored. A sentinel examines the elder's token and nods. "The Library is west, through the Glass Wastes. Travel with the next ship at dawn. Rest tonight."
[[Rest with the Nomads->NomadCamp-WithMoth]]
[[Ask about the map fragments->NomadCamp-WithMoth-MapQuery]]

:: ScavengerRuin-WithMoth
[[Head to the rendezvous->NomadRendezvous-WithMoth]]
::UnionOutpost-Gate-MapFragment
"I have a map fragment leading to Haven-0," you declare. The scanner pauses. "Haven-0 is a myth. But the fragment is of interest. Enter for evaluation." The dome's airlock hisses open.
[[Enter the outpost->UnionOutpost-Interior-MapFragment]]

::UnionOutpost-Gate-Scholar
"I seek knowledge of the old world," you say. The voice responds, "Knowledge has a price. What do you offer?" The gate remains sealed.
[[Offer the drone core if you have it->UnionOutpost-Gate-Scholar-DroneCore]]
[[Claim to have information on Legion movements->UnionOutpost-Gate-Scholar-Intel]]
::BadlandsTrail-LyraHideout
You approach the metal hatch. It's unlocked. Inside, a narrow staircase descends into a bunker. Lyra is at a workbench, her back to you. "I know you're there," she says without turning. "If you were Legion, I'd be dead already. Come in. Close the hatch."
[[Enter the bunker->BadlandsTrail-LyraMet]]

:: BadlandsTrail-LyraHideoutWait
[[Ask about her hideout->BadlandsTrail-LyraMet]]
::BadlandsTrail-LyraMet-LegionInterest
"The Legion wants Haven-0 for control," Lyra says bitterly. "They'd use it to rule the wastes, not heal them. Captain Hale believes the Cataclysm was a necessary purge. He's wrong. My faction, the Union, exiled me for saying so."
[[Offer to help against the Legion->BadlandsTrail-LyraMet-OfferHelp]]
[[Ask about the other fragments->BadlandsTrail-LyraMet-OfferHelp]]

:: BadlandsTrail-LyraMet-OfferHelp
[[Agree to ally with Lyra->BadlandsTrail-LyraAlly]]
::BlastedFlats-ExileStart
Thirst claws at your throat. You search the flats for any sign of water. A rusted pipe leads to a small, foul-looking puddle. It's your only hope.
[[Drink the water->BlastedFlats-ExileSick]]
[[Keep searching->BlastedFlats-ExileFollow]]

::BlastedFlats-ExileFollow
You follow faint tracks in the ash. They lead to a small campfire site, recently used. A discarded Nomad water skin lies there, still holding a few precious drops.
[[Take the water and rest->BlastedFlats-ExileRecover]]
[[Follow the tracks further->NomadRendezvous-Approach]]
::HighlandsTrail-LibraryDetour-WithMoth
You and Moth turn away from the Union outpost, following the drone's map toward the Sunken Library. The path descends into a valley choked with crystalline ash. The library's spires emerge from the mist ahead.
[[Approach the library entrance->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth]]
::MercyEnd-AlleyFight-Legion
You make a break for it, shoving a soldier into his comrades. A shot rings out, tearing through your shoulder. You stagger into the market, bleeding, as shouts echo behind you.
[[Try to lose them in the crowd->MercyEnd-Market-Escape]]
[[Head for the well, hoping for sanctuary->MercyEnd-WellHide]]

::MercyEnd-ArmorySneak
You sneak down the hallway, avoiding patrols. The armory door is ajar. Inside, you see your pack on a table. A lone guard stands with his back to you.
[[Knock out the guard->MercyEnd-ArmoryRecover]]
[[Sneak past to retrieve your pack->MercyEnd-ArmoryGrab]]

::MercyEnd-FalseRecruit
You take the patrol route, pretending to hunt for Moth. Once out of sight of the settlement, you ditch the Legion gear and head east. You're a deserter now, hunted by the very force you pretended to join.
[[Travel to the highlands->HighlandsTrail-Deserter]]
[[Search for Lyra's hideout->BadlandsTrail-LyraSighting]]

::MercyEnd-Gully-WithMoth-Lyra
In the gully, you catch your breath. Lyra studies her device. "The Legion will sweep this area soon. We need to move. I know a safe route to the highlands." Moth checks her supplies. "I can guide us part of the way."
[[Follow Lyra's route->HighlandsTrail-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Split up, with Moth going to the Nomads->NomadRendezvous-WithMoth]]

::MercyEnd-Market-Escape
You blend into the market crowd, clutching your wounded shoulder. You duck into a textile stall, pulling a dusty cloak over yourself. The Legion soldiers rush past, not noticing you.
[[Wait until dark to escape->MercyEnd-GateExit-Night]]
[[Seek a healer in the market->MercyEnd-Healer]]

::MercyEnd-MothHunt
You patrol the outskirts of Mercy's End, following Moth's known routes. You find a recent footprint near the rock outcrop. She's heading east, toward Nomad lands. The Legion expects results.
[[Track Moth diligently->HighlandsTrail-MothHunt]]
[[Fake her death and report back->MercyEnd-LegionReport]]

::MercyEnd-WallEscape
You find a drainage tunnel leading under the wall. It's flooded with knee-deep, foul water. You wade through, emerging outside the settlement into a ditch. Freedom, but you're soaked and shivering.
[[Head for the highlands->HighlandsTrail-Alone-Wet]]
[[Search for shelter->BlastedFlats-DitchShelter]]

::MountainPass-Ascent
The mountain pass is steep and lonely. Wind whips ash into swirling devils. A crude totem stands at a fork in the path—skulls and feathers. The Ashen Choir marks its territory.
[[Take the left path, past the totem->MountainPass-ChoirTerritory]]
[[Take the right path, skirting the rocks->MountainPass-RockyTrail]]
::MountainPass-ChoirRitual
You watch from a ledge. The robed figures pour ash into the pit, chanting praises to the "Grey Mother." One figure breaks from the circle, sensing your presence. They point up at your hiding spot.
[[Flee immediately->MountainPass-ChoirSneak]]
[[Stand your ground->MountainPass-ChoirConfront]]

::MountainPass-ChoirSneak
You slip into the narrow side passage. It winds through the canyon wall, emerging above the ritual site. You can see a path leading deeper into the mountains, away from the Choir.
[[Take the mountain path->MountainPass-Ascent]]
[[Descend toward the Skybreaker ruins->MountainPass-SkybreakerView]]

:: MountainPass-SkybreakerView
[[Approach the ruins under cover of battle->Skybreaker-Approach]]
::NomadCamp-WithMoth
The Nomad camp is a vibrant collection of tents and sand-ships. Moth introduces you to her tribe. They share a meal of roasted lizard and stories of the wastes. The elder speaks of the Library's guardians.
[[Ask about the guardians->NomadCamp-WithMoth-Guardians]]
[[Rest for the journey->NomadCamp-WithMoth-Rest]]

::NomadCamp-WithMoth-MapQuery
"The Sunken Library holds many secrets," the elder says. "One fragment is said to be there, guarded by the Silent Order. They test all who enter. Your map will be your key, but your heart will be your guide."
[[Prepare for the library->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth]]
[[Learn more about the Silent Order->NomadCamp-WithMoth-Order]]

::NomadRendezvous-WithMoth-Token-Gear
You arrive at the rendezvous with the new gear. The Nomad sentinel is impressed. "A good mask is life out here. You travel on the dawn ship. Rest well." Moth secures a spot for you on a sand-ship.
[[Board the sand-ship->NomadCamp-WithMoth-Gear]]
::ScavengerRuin-WithMoth-Deeper
You venture deeper into the ruin, pushing through a collapsed doorway. In a sealed vault, you find a functional energy pistol and a case of old-world medical supplies. A significant find.
[[Return to the surface->ScavengerRuin-WithMoth-Gear]]
[[Search for a way out the other side->ScavengerRuin-WithMoth-Exit]]

::UnionOutpost-Gate-Scholar-DroneCore
"I have a Union drone core," you say, holding it up. The scanner beam focuses on it. "Core identified. Acceptable trade. Enter." The gate opens into a clean, well-lit corridor.
[[Enter the outpost->UnionOutpost-Interior-DroneCore]]

::UnionOutpost-Gate-Scholar-Intel
"The Legion is planning an assault on the Skybreaker ruins," you report. The voice is silent for a moment. "This intelligence has value. Enter. You will be debriefed." The airlock cycles open.
[[Enter the outpost->UnionOutpost-Interior-Intel]]

::UnionOutpost-Gate-WithMoth-HasDroneCore
Moth presents the drone core. "We found your scout. It had interesting data." The scanner acknowledges. "Core retrieval noted. Both of you may enter." The dome admits you.
[[Enter the outpost->UnionOutpost-Interior-WithMoth-DroneCore]]

::UnionOutpost-Interior-MapFragment
Inside, a Union technician in a clean-suit greets you. "Haven-0? A fascinating myth. Let me see the fragment." He studies it under a light. "This is genuine pre-Cataclysm cartography. But it's encrypted. We have the cipher, but it will require... negotiation."
[[Negotiate for the cipher->UnionOutpost-Negotiation-MapFragment]]
[[Refuse and leave->UnionOutpost-Exit-MapFragment]]
::BadlandsTrail-Alone
You stand alone in the badlands. Lyra is gone, her trail cold. Your map fragment feels heavy, a puzzle with no key. The only path is east, toward the mountains and the rumors of the Sunken Library.
[[Head east->MountainPass-Alone]]

:: BlastedFlats-DitchShelter
You find a shallow ditch offering meager shelter from the wind. You huddle there, cold and wet, as night falls. The lights of Mercy's End are distant stars. Dawn will bring a decision.
[[Head for the highlands at first light->HighlandsTrail-Alone-Wet]]
[[Travel toward Nomad territory->NomadRendezvous-Exile-Alone]]
::BlastedFlats-ExileRecover
The few drops of water revive you. You rest by the ashes of the campfire, gathering strength. The tracks lead northeast, toward Nomad lands. It is a slim hope, but hope nonetheless.
[[Follow the tracks->NomadRendezvous-Approach]]
::BlastedFlats-ExileSick
The foul water burns your throat. Soon, cramps double you over. You vomit into the ash, weaker than before. The settlement is too far to reach. The wastes are unforgiving.
[[Lie down and rest->Ending-ExileSick]]

::HighlandsTrail-Alone-Wet
You climb into the highlands, shivering. Your wet clothes cling to you in the cold air. A cave offers shelter. Inside, you find remnants of an old camp—a dry blanket and some tinder.
[[Rest and warm up->MountainPass-CaveRest]]
[[Push on toward the Union outpost->UnionOutpost-Gate-Scholar]]

:: HighlandsTrail-Deserter
You take the patrol route, pretending to hunt for Moth. Once out of sight of the settlement, you ditch the Legion gear and head east. You're a deserter now, hunted by the very force you pretended to join.
[[Travel to the highlands->HighlandsTrail-Alone-Deserter]]
[[Search for Lyra's hideout->BadlandsTrail-LyraSighting]]
::HighlandsTrail-MothHunt
You find clear signs of Moth's passage—a distinctive footprint, a dropped Nomad charm. She is heading for the highlands, likely to the Union outpost or the library. The Legion expects her capture.
[[Continue the hunt toward the outpost->UnionOutpost-Gate-MothHunt]]
[[Track her toward the library->SunkenLibrary-Gate-MothHunt]]

:: HighlandsTrail-WithMoth-Lyra
The trio moves efficiently through the highlands. Lyra's tech avoids ash sinks, and Moth's knowledge finds the easiest paths. The Sunken Library is your shared goal, a place of answers and danger.
[[Approach the Sunken Library->SunkenLibrary-Approach-WithMoth-Lyra]]
::MercyEnd-ArmoryGrab
You slip past the guard and grab your pack. The map fragment is still inside. You retreat silently from the armory, your heart pounding. Now to escape the compound.
[[Head for the drainage tunnel->MercyEnd-WallEscape]]

::MercyEnd-ArmoryRecover
You strike the guard's head with a piece of pipe. He slumps to the floor. You retrieve your pack and his sidearm. Armed and with your map, you have a fighting chance.
[[Fight your way out->MercyEnd-AlleyFight-Legion]]
[[Sneak out through the drainage tunnel->MercyEnd-WallEscape]]

:: MercyEnd-GateExit-Night
Under cover of darkness, you slip through the main gate. The guards are inattentive. The ash fields are silent under a starless sky. You are free, but wounded and alone.
[[Head for the highlands->HighlandsTrail-Alone-Wet]]
[[Seek the Nomad rendezvous->NomadRendezvous-Exile-Alone]]
::MercyEnd-Healer
You find a healer's tent. The woman inside wordlessly cleans your wound and applies a poultice. "The Legion searches for a red-haired woman," she whispers. "They will not look here tonight. Rest."
[[Rest until dawn->MercyEnd-GateExit-Night]]

::MercyEnd-LegionReport
You return to Captain Hale, claiming Moth fell into a ravine during your pursuit. He studies you coldly. "A convenient loss. You will be reassigned to the Skybreaker assault. Prove your loyalty there."
[[Join the Skybreaker assault->MountainPass-SkybreakerView]]

::MercyEnd-WellHide-Alone
You decline Lyra's offer. She climbs out alone, leaving you in the cistern. The sound of Legion searches grows louder above. Your choices are few.
[[Wait it out->MercyEnd-LegionAmbush]]
[[Climb out and take your chances->MercyEnd-GateExit]]

::MercyEnd-WellHide-Distraction
"You go. I'll lead them away," you say. Lyra hesitates, then nods. "Thank you." She disappears into the vent. You prepare to face the Legion, a sacrifice for a potential ally.
[[Confront the soldiers->MercyEnd-LegionAmbush]]

::MountainPass-BattleWatch
You watch from the ridge. The Legion forces eventually breach the main door and pour into the Skybreaker ruins. The defending fire ceases. The facility is now under Legion control.
[[Approach the ruins now that the battle is over->Skybreaker-Approach-Quiet]]
[[Avoid the Legion-held ruins->MountainPass-Ascent]]

::MountainPass-CaveRest
You rest in the relative safety of the cave. The storm subsides, revealing a clear, cold night. The murals of Haven-0 glow faintly in the moonlight, a promise or a warning.
[[Study the murals->MountainPass-Murals]]
[[Continue your journey at dawn->MountainPass-Ascent]]
::MountainPass-ChoirConfront
You stand up, hands open. The chanting stops. A tall figure with ash-painted eyes approaches. "You trespass on sacred ground. Why does the Grey Mother bring you here?"
[[Say you seek knowledge->MountainPass-ChoirDialogue]]
[[Say you are lost->MountainPass-ChoirMercy]]

::MountainPass-Murals
The murals show a gleaming arcology, Haven-0, purifying the skies. But other images depict it as a weapon, raining fire. The final mural is defaced, its meaning lost. What is the true purpose of Haven-0?
[[Take it as a sign of hope->MountainPass-Ascent-Hopeful]]
[[See it as a warning->MountainPass-Ascent-Wary]]
::NomadCamp-WithMoth-Gear
You board the sand-ship at dawn. The wind fills the sails, and the ship glides over the ash. Moth points ahead. "The Glass Wastes. The Library is beyond." The journey begins.
[[Travel across the wastes->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth]]

::NomadCamp-WithMoth-Guardians
"The Silent Order are not human," the elder explains. "They are remnants of the old world's automata. They test seekers with illusions of their deepest fears. Only the worthy may pass."
[[Accept the challenge->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth]]

::NomadCamp-WithMoth-Order
"The Order protects knowledge from those who would abuse it," a Nomad storyteller says. "They value intent above all. Your reason for seeking the fragment will be your greatest weapon or your downfall."
[[Prepare to face the test->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth]]

:: NomadCamp-WithMoth-Rest
[[Board the sand-ship->NomadCamp-WithMoth]]
::NomadRendezvous-WithMoth
You and Moth part ways with Lyra. Moth leads you to the Nomad rendezvous. The sentinel accepts the elder's token. "You travel at dawn. Rest now."
[[Rest at the camp->NomadCamp-WithMoth]]

:: ScavengerRuin-WithMoth-Exit
[[Descend to the rendezvous->NomadRendezvous-WithMoth]]
::ScavengerRuin-WithMoth-Gear
You return to the surface with the energy pistol and medkit. Moth is impressed. "This changes our odds. Let's get to the Nomads." You set off, better equipped for the wastes.
[[Head to the rendezvous->NomadRendezvous-WithMoth-Token-Gear]]

::Skybreaker-Approach-Chaos
You approach the Skybreaker ruins under the cover of the ongoing battle. Legion troops are engaged with automated turrets inside the entrance. You slip through a shattered side window unnoticed.
[[Enter the ruins->Skybreaker-Interior-Chaos]]

::SunkenLibrary-Approach-WithLyra
Lyra leads you through the badlands, her scanner active. The Sunken Library rises ahead, half-buried in ash. "The signal is strong. But we are alone here. We must be cautious."
[[Approach the main entrance->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithLyra]]
::SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth
The great gate of the Sunken Library is sealed, covered in intricate carvings. Moth places the elder's token against a recess. The carvings glow, and the gate begins to grind open.
[[Enter the library->SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth]]

::UnionOutpost-Exit-MapFragment
You decline the Union's offer. The gate seals behind you. Your map remains a mystery.
[[Head for the library anyway->HighlandsTrail-LibraryDetour-Alone]]
::UnionOutpost-Interior-DroneCore
The technician takes the drone core. "This data is valuable. In return, we offer access to our archives. You may find clues to your map's cipher there." He leads you to a terminal.
[[Search the archives->UnionOutpost-Archives-DroneCore]]

:: UnionOutpost-Interior-Intel
[[Take safe passage->HighlandsTrail-Alone]]
:: UnionOutpost-Interior-WithMoth-DroneCore
[[Decline and leave->UnionOutpost-Exit-WithMoth]]
::UnionOutpost-Negotiation-MapFragment
"The cipher is a Union asset," the technician says. "We will decrypt your fragment if you agree to share any Haven-0 location data with us exclusively. This is non-negotiable."
[[Agree to the terms->UnionOutpost-Decrypt-MapFragment]]
[[Refuse and leave->UnionOutpost-Exit-MapFragment]]
::Ending-ExileSick
The sickness takes you. You curl in the ash, the world spinning. Thirst gives way to fever dreams of clear water and green fields. The ash drifts over you, a final grey blanket. The wastes have claimed another soul.

::MountainPass-Ascent-Hopeful
The murals fill you with purpose. Haven-0 is a beacon. You climb with renewed energy, the hope of a cleansed world driving you forward. The path ahead is difficult, but the goal is worthy.
[[Continue toward the Skybreaker ruins->MountainPass-SkybreakerView]]
::MountainPass-Ascent-Wary
The murals warn of a weapon. You ascend cautiously, every shadow a potential threat. Haven-0 could be salvation or damnation. You must be ready for either outcome.
[[Continue toward the Skybreaker ruins->MountainPass-SkybreakerView]]
::MountainPass-ChoirDialogue
"I seek knowledge of the old world," you say. The ash-painted figure considers you. "Knowledge without faith is a poison. The Grey Mother offers truth, but you must accept her embrace." They gesture to the smoking pit.
[[Accept their teachings->MountainPass-ChoirInitiation]]
[[Refuse and ask for safe passage->MountainPass-ChoirMercy]]

::MountainPass-ChoirMercy
"I am only lost," you say. The figure studies you, then nods. "The lost may be guided. Leave this place. Go east, and do not return. The Mother is merciful this day." They point to a narrow exit.
[[Take the offered escape->MountainPass-Ascent]]
::Skybreaker-Approach-Quiet
The battle is over. Legion flags fly over the Skybreaker entrance. A few guards patrol the perimeter. The silence is unnerving. A service hatch on the north side appears unguarded.
[[Sneak in through the service hatch->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak]]
[[Wait for a shift change->Skybreaker-Approach-Wait]]

::Skybreaker-Interior-Chaos
Inside, the ruins are a maze of shattered machinery and flickering lights. Legion soldiers exchange fire with unseen defenders deep within. The chaos provides cover. A sign points to "GeoCore Vault" down a side corridor.
[[Head for the GeoCore Vault->Skybreaker-VaultApproach]]
[[Search for the central control room->Skybreaker-ControlRoomApproach]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-MothHunt
The library gate is immense. You find signs of Moth's passage here—a dropped scarf. The gate is sealed. You must find a way in to continue your hunt.
[[Search for a hidden entrance->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Search]]
[[Attempt to force the gate->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Force]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithLyra
The library gate is formidable. Lyra scans it. "The lock is ancient but mechanical. I can bypass it, but it will take time. Keep watch." She works on a panel beside the gate.
[[Stand guard->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Guard]]
[[Help Lyra with the mechanism->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Help]]

::SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth
You step into a vast hall, shelves stretching into darkness. The air is still and cold. Moth whispers, "The Silent Order." Ahead, a figure made of light and shadow glides forward. It raises a hand, and the world around you shifts.
[[Face the illusion->SunkenLibrary-Test-WithMoth]]

::UnionOutpost-Archives-DroneCore
The archives are vast. You search for hours, cross-referencing symbols from your fragment. You find a match: a schematic of the Sunken Library, with a chamber marked "Cipher Stone."
[[Note the location and leave->HighlandsTrail-LibraryDetour-Alone]]
:: UnionOutpost-Armory-Intel
[[Exit to the highlands->HighlandsTrail-Alone]]
::UnionOutpost-Decrypt-MapFragment
The technician decrypts your map. The route to the Sunken Library is now clear. "The Union keeps its copy. You are free to go." The gate seals behind you.
[[Head for the library->HighlandsTrail-LibraryDetour-Alone]]
::UnionOutpost-Gate-MothHunt
You approach the outpost gate. The scanner identifies you as Legion. "Legion patrol, state your purpose." You must maintain your cover.
[[Claim to be tracking a fugitive->UnionOutpost-Gate-MothHunt-Fugitive]]
[[Demand entry for resupply->UnionOutpost-Gate-MothHunt-Resupply]]

::UnionOutpost-Negotiation-WithMoth
The specialist lays out the terms. "We decrypt your map, and we keep a copy. Moth vouches for you, so we trust you will honor this." Moth looks at you, awaiting your decision.
[[Agree->UnionOutpost-Decrypt-WithMoth]]
[[Decline->UnionOutpost-Exit-WithMoth]]
::MountainPass-ChoirInitiation
The figure leads you to the smoking pit. "Kneel and accept the ash," they command. You kneel, and they smear warm ash on your forehead. "You are now a child of the Grey Mother. The old world must stay dead. Haven-0 is a blasphemy. You will help us ensure it remains buried." A sense of grim purpose fills you.
[[Accept the mission->MountainPass-Ascent-ChoirInitiated]]

::Skybreaker-Approach-Wait
You wait for hours, watching the patrols. At dusk, the guards change shift. For a few minutes, the main entrance is less guarded. This is your chance.
[[Sneak to the entrance->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak]]
[[Find another way in->Skybreaker-Approach-Chaos]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoomApproach
You follow signs to the central control room. The hallway is littered with Legion dead and shattered automata. The room ahead has a large viewscreen showing a schematic of the facility. An old man in a tattered lab coat is frantically typing at a console.
[[Approach the old man->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet]]

::Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak
The service hatch leads into a maintenance tunnel. It is dark and cramped, but empty. You follow it deep into the facility, emerging into a quiet corridor far from the main entrance.
[[Explore the corridor->Skybreaker-VaultApproach]]
[[Head toward the sounds of conflict->Skybreaker-Interior-Chaos]]

:: Skybreaker-VaultApproach
[[Enter the vault->Skybreaker-Vault-Exterior]]
::SunkenLibrary-Gate-Force
You try to force the gate open with a metal bar. The ancient mechanism groans but does not budge. An alarm blares, and the ground trembles. A massive stone guardian rises from the ash nearby, its eyes glowing red.
[[Fight the guardian->SunkenLibrary-GuardianFight]]
[[Retreat and find another way->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Search]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-Guard
You keep watch while Lyra works. The badlands are silent. After a long while, Lyra smiles. "Got it." The gate groans and begins to swing inward, revealing a dark antechamber.
[[Enter the library with Lyra->SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithLyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-Help
You help Lyra by holding wires while she reroutes the power. Your combined efforts pay off. The gate's locking mechanism disengages with a loud clank, and the doors slowly open.
[[Step inside->SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithLyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-Search
You search the perimeter of the gate and find a hidden crevice behind a fallen pillar. It leads to a narrow tunnel that snakes into the library's foundation.
[[Crawl through the tunnel->SunkenLibrary-Interior-Sneak]]

::SunkenLibrary-Test-WithMoth
The world melts away. You stand in a field of green grass under a blue sky. It is a perfect memory of the world before the Cataclysm. Moth is gone. A voice whispers, "Is this what you seek? To erase the present for a forgotten past?"
[[Embrace the illusion->SunkenLibrary-Test-Embrace]]
[[Reject the illusion->SunkenLibrary-Test-Reject]]

::UnionOutpost-Decrypt-WithMoth
The specialist decrypts your map. The route to the Sunken Library is now clear. Moth smiles. "We have our path." The Union keeps their copy, and you are free to go.
[[Leave for the library->HighlandsTrail-LibraryDetour-WithMoth]]

:: UnionOutpost-Exit-WithMoth
You decline the Union's offer. Moth looks disappointed but follows you out. The gate seals behind you. Your map remains a mystery.
[[Head for the library anyway->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth]]
::UnionOutpost-Gate-MothHunt-Fugitive
"I am tracking a fugitive courier," you state. "She may have sought shelter here." The scanner is silent for a moment. "No fugitives detected. Entry denied. Legion patrols are not welcome."
[[Withdraw and continue the hunt->HighlandsTrail-MothHunt]]

::UnionOutpost-Gate-MothHunt-Resupply
"Open this gate for Legion resupply!" you demand. The voice responds coldly. "The Union does not supply the Legion. Leave now, or you will be fired upon." Turrets on the dome swivel toward you.
[[Retreat quickly->HighlandsTrail-MothHunt]]
::MountainPass-Ascent-ChoirInitiated
You climb the mountain path, the ash on your forehead a constant reminder of your new allegiance. The Ashen Choir's mission is clear: prevent the heresy of Haven-0. The path leads to a high overlook where you see the Skybreaker ruins below, a scar on the Grey Mother's face. A Choir sentinel awaits you there.
[[Descend to the ruins on the Choir's mission->Skybreaker-Approach-ChoirInitiated]]
::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet
The old man spins around, terrified. "Stay back! The failsafe is armed!" He is Dr. Oren Vale. The viewscreen shows a countdown. "The Legion will trigger a meltdown to deny the facility to others. I can stop it, but I need time!"
[[Help Vale disarm the failsafe->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-HelpVale]]
[[Demand information about Haven-0->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-QuestionVale]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Exterior
Outside the vault door, control panels flicker. A maintenance log on a dataslate mentions a backup access tunnel for emergencies, leading directly to the GeoCore chamber. The sounds of battle are getting closer.
[[Enter the vault through the main door->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior]]
[[Search for the backup tunnel->Skybreaker-Vault-BackupEntry]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Interior
The GeoCore chamber hums with immense power. Glowing energy canisters line the walls. In the center, a pedestal holds a data-crystal—the third map fragment. It is unprotected, but the air crackles with latent energy.
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken]]
[[Investigate the core controls first->Skybreaker-Vault-CoreControls]]

::SunkenLibrary-GuardianFight
The stone guardian lumbers toward you, its fists like boulders. It swings, and you dive aside. The ground shakes. Fighting it head-on seems impossible. A narrow canyon to your left might offer a chance to outmaneuver it.
[[Make a stand and fight->SunkenLibrary-GuardianFight-Stand]]
[[Retreat into the canyon->SunkenLibrary-GuardianFight-Retreat]]

:: SunkenLibrary-Interior-Sneak
[[Explore the glowing chamber->SunkenLibrary-Archive-Chamber-Sneak]]
::SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithLyra
Lyra leads the way with a soft light from her bracelet. The grand hall is silent. "The signal is coming from deeper inside," she whispers. A vast atrium opens ahead, and in its center, on a stone dais, rests a crystalline tablet—the second fragment.
[[Approach the dais->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Approach-WithLyra]]
[[Scan the area for traps->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Scan-WithLyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Test-Embrace
You step into the field of green, breathing the clean air. This is the world you lost. The voice speaks again, "To restore this, you must erase the world that is. The present, its people, all must be sacrificed. Is it worth the cost?"
[[Accept the cost->SunkenLibrary-Test-Embrace-Accept]]
[[Hesitate, remembering the wastes->SunkenLibrary-Test-Reject]]

::SunkenLibrary-Test-Reject
"You offer a beautiful grave," you say to the voice. "But the world of the living, however broken, is real." The green field shatters like glass, and you are back in the dark library hall. Moth stands beside you, shaken. The Silent Order guardian bows its head and gestures to a passage leading deeper inward.
[[Proceed down the passage->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-WithMoth]]
::Skybreaker-Approach-ChoirInitiated
The sentinel points a bony finger toward the Skybreaker ruins. "The Legion defiles the Mother's sanctum. You will enter and sabotage their efforts. The GeoCore must be destabilized. Go, child of ash." You descend the scree slope, your new faith a cold fire in your chest.
[[Enter the ruins through a blast vent->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-ChoirInitiated]]
::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-HelpVale
You rush to the console. "Tell me what to do!" Vale points to a sequence of commands. "Override the primary lockdown! The Legion has bypassed the safeties!" You type frantically as alarms blare. The countdown pauses at ten seconds.
[[Assist Vale in securing the room->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Secured]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-QuestionVale
"Tell me about Haven-0!" you demand, grabbing Vale's arm. He trembles. "It's real! But it's not a savior—it's a judge! It will purge the unworthy! The Legion must not control it!" The countdown continues, now below thirty seconds.
[[Help him stop the meltdown->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-HelpVale]]
[[Abandon him to his fate->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Abandon]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-BackupEntry
You find a hidden panel behind a collapsed shelving unit. It opens into a narrow, dark tunnel. You crawl through, emerging inside the GeoCore vault, unnoticed. The fragment glows on its pedestal.
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken]]
[[Remain hidden and observe->Skybreaker-Vault-Observe]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-CoreControls
You examine the core controls. A diagnostic screen shows the core is unstable—the Legion's assault has damaged the containment field. Stabilizing it would prevent a catastrophe, but it would take time. The fragment beckons.
[[Attempt to stabilize the core->Skybreaker-Vault-Stabilize]]
[[Ignore the core and take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken
You grasp the data-crystal. It is cool and heavy in your hand. The third fragment. As you lift it, a deep hum surges through the vault. Red lights flash. A voice blares from hidden speakers: "Unauthorized removal. Containment breach imminent."
[[Escape the vault quickly->Skybreaker-Vault-Escape]]
[[Try to replace the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-Replace]]

::SunkenLibrary-Archive-Chamber
The chamber glows with a soft blue light. In its center, a pedestal holds not a fragment, but an ancient data-slate. It displays a star chart, one point pulsating—the location of Haven-0. This is a crucial piece of the puzzle.
[[Take the data-slate->SunkenLibrary-Archive-SlateTaken]]
[[Study the chart further->SunkenLibrary-Archive-Study]]

:: SunkenLibrary-Archive-Search
[[Leave the items and continue searching->SunkenLibrary-Archive-Chamber-Search]]
::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Approach-WithLyra
You step toward the dais. Lyra warns, "Wait! There's a energy field." But it is too late. A shimmering barrier snaps into existence around the dais, trapping you inside. Lyra pounds on the field from the outside. "I'll find a way to disable it!"
[[Wait for Lyra to free you->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Trapped]]
[[Try to break the field from within->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-BreakField]]
::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Scan-WithLyra
Lyra scans the dais with her bracelet. "The field is triggered by pressure on the dais. There's a control node on the far wall." She points to a faintly glowing symbol. "I can reach it from here with an energy pulse."
[[Let Lyra disable the trap->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Safe]]
[[Distract the trap while she works->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Distract]]

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-WithMoth
The passage opens into a vast atrium. The second fragment rests on a stone dais, unguarded. Moth looks at you. "The test is passed. The fragment is ours." You approach the dais, the prize within reach.
[[Take the fragment->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-FragmentTaken-WithMoth]]
[[Let Moth take it->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-MothTakesFragment]]

::SunkenLibrary-GuardianFight-Retreat
You dart into the narrow canyon. The guardian is too large to follow. It smashes the canyon entrance in frustration, sealing you inside. The canyon winds downward, leading to a hidden entrance into the library's lower levels.
[[Enter the library through the new opening->SunkenLibrary-Interior-Sneak]]

::SunkenLibrary-GuardianFight-Stand
You stand your ground, firing your weapon. The shots spark harmlessly off the stone hide. The guardian swings its massive fist. You try to evade, but the blow catches you, throwing you against the gate. The world fades to black.
[[Awaken captured->SunkenLibrary-Captured]]
::SunkenLibrary-Test-Embrace-Accept
"Yes," you whisper. "The cost is worth it." The green field brightens, consuming you. The voice is satisfied. "Then you are the instrument of restoration. The old world will live again." You are no longer in the library. You are elsewhere, and your purpose is clear.
[[Begin the pilgrimage->Haven0-Approach-Restorer]]
::Haven0-Approach-Restorer
The path ends at a colossal structure of white alloy, untouched by ash. Haven-0. The air is clean. The great door is sealed, but a terminal flickers beside it. The final choice awaits. You hold all four fragments. The purifier can be activated, but at what cost to the present?
[[Activate the purifier->Ending-Restoration]]
[[Seize control for yourself->Ending-Dominion]]
[[Destroy Haven-0->Ending-Nomad]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Abandon
You leave Dr. Vale to his fate, fleeing the control room as the countdown reaches zero. A deafening roar and a wave of heat engulf the facility. The Skybreaker ruins collapse into a molten crater. The third fragment is lost, and with it, the hope of Haven-0.
[[Escape the ruins->Ending-SkybreakerDestroyed]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Secured
You and Vale successfully lock down the control room. The meltdown is averted. Vale slumps in relief. "Thank you. The Legion retreats, for now. The fragment... it's in the GeoCore vault. We must retrieve it before they regroup."
[[Go to the GeoCore vault->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Secured]]

::Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-ChoirInitiated
You slip into the ruins, the Choir's ash on your brow a shield against the facility's defilement. Your mission is clear: corruption, not conquest. You follow conduits toward the deep geothermal heart, where the core's instability can be turned into a weapon for the Grey Mother.
[[Reach the GeoCore vault->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-ChoirInitiated]]
::Skybreaker-Vault-Escape
You sprint from the vault as alarms scream. The hallway shakes. Behind you, the GeoCore containment fails in a flash of blinding light. The shockwave throws you forward. You have the fragment, but the Skybreaker is dying around you.
[[Race for the exit->Ending-SkybreakerEscape]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Observe
You stay hidden in the backup tunnel. Legion soldiers enter the vault, followed by Captain Hale himself. He takes the fragment from the pedestal. "Haven-0 will be ours," he declares. They leave, unaware of the core's critical instability. You are alone with a ticking bomb.
[[Attempt to stabilize the core->Skybreaker-Vault-Stabilize]]
[[Flee before the meltdown->Skybreaker-Vault-Escape]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Replace
You quickly place the fragment back on the pedestal. The humming subsides, and the red lights cease. The containment breach is averted. But the fragment is still here, and the Legion is still coming.
[[Leave the vault and hide->Skybreaker-Vault-Exterior-Hide]]
[[Try to take the fragment again more carefully->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentRetry]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Stabilize
You work at the core controls, rerouting power to reinforce the containment field. The humming steadies. The warning lights fade. The core is stable. The fragment is safe to take, and you have prevented a disaster.
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-Safe]]
[[Leave the fragment and find Vale->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet]]

::SunkenLibrary-Archive-FragmentFound
You take the leather satchel. The map fragment is inside, along with the journal. The journal speaks of the Silent Order's duty to test seekers, and of a "Judgment" awaiting at Haven-0. You have the second piece of the puzzle.
[[Leave the archive->SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth-Fragment]]

::SunkenLibrary-Archive-SlateTaken
You take the data-slate. The pulsating point on the star chart is a clear coordinate—the final key to locating Haven-0. This is not a fragment, but a guide. With this and your fragments, the path is clear.
[[Continue your search for the second fragment->SunkenLibrary-Archive-Search]]
[[Leave the library with the slate->SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithMoth-Slate]]

::SunkenLibrary-Archive-Study
You study the star chart. The pulsating point is labeled "Haven-0 Prime." Other points are marked "GeoCore" and "Skybreaker." The chart shows that the facility requires a massive power source to activate. The Skybreaker ruins make sense now.
[[Memorize the chart and leave the slate->SunkenLibrary-Archive-Search]]
[[Take the slate->SunkenLibrary-Archive-SlateTaken]]

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-BreakField
You pound on the energy field, but it absorbs the impact. Lyra shouts, "It's reflecting the energy back! Stop!" A shock of force throws you to the ground. The field holds strong. You are trapped, and the library's guardians are stirring.
[[Wait for Lyra's solution->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Trapped]]
::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Distract
You step toward the dais, drawing the energy field's attention. It shimmers around you. Lyra fires her energy pulse at the control node. The field flickers and dies just as it solidifies, leaving you free and the dais unprotected.
[[Take the fragment->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-FragmentTaken-WithLyra]]

[[Leave the library->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Exit-WithMoth]]
:: SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Safe
[[Leave the atrium with Lyra->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Exit-WithLyra]]
::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Trapped
You are stuck inside the energy field. Lyra works frantically at the control node. "I need more power!" She reroutes her bracelet's energy, causing it to smoke. The field flickers weakly but doesn't drop. The sound of stone grinding echoes—a guardian is coming.
[[Prepare to fight the guardian from inside the field->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-GuardianFight]]
[[Urge Lyra to run->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-UrgeEscape]]
::SunkenLibrary-Captured
You awake in a dim cell carved from black rock. Your weapons are gone. A Choir acolyte looks through the bars. "The guardian brought you to us. You sought the fragment. Why defy the Grey Mother?" Your fate is in their hands.
[[Plead your case->SunkenLibrary-Captured-Plea]]
[[Remain defiant->SunkenLibrary-Captured-Defiant]]
::Ending-Dominion
You input the fragments into the terminal. The great door of Haven-0 slides open. You step into the control throne. The purifier is a weapon, and you hold the trigger. The wastes will kneel, or they will choke. A new order begins today, with you as its absolute ruler.


::Ending-Nomad
You set the charges at the base of the great door. The explosion rocks the valley. Haven-0 collapses into a pile of molten slag. No faction will ever control it. The wastes remain free, harsh, and true. Moth nods, a sad smile on her face. This was the only way.


::Ending-Restoration
The fragments align. The terminal glows. A hum builds within Haven-0, growing to a deafening roar. On the viewscreen, the ash clouds begin to part. A sliver of blue sky appears for the first time in generations. The long winter is over.


::Ending-SkybreakerDestroyed
You stagger from the collapsing ruins, the heat blistering your back. The Skybreaker sinks into a lake of fire, taking the fragment and Dr. Vale with it. The hope of Haven-0 is buried under molten rock. You are alone in a world now devoid of its last chance.


::Ending-SkybreakerEscape
You burst from the ruins as the GeoCore detonates. The shockwave propels you into the ash. You survive, the third fragment clutched in your hand. But the Skybreaker is gone, a crater filled with chaos. The path to Haven-0 remains, but the cost is written in fire.


::Skybreaker-Vault-Exterior-Hide
You slip out of the vault and hide in a nearby maintenance closet. Legion soldiers storm past, heading for the vault. They find the fragment undisturbed. You wait until the coast is clear, the fragment still within reach but now heavily guarded.
[[Wait for an opportunity to steal it->Skybreaker-VaultApproach]]
[[Abandon the fragment and escape->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentRetry
You study the pedestal. The security system is active. You notice a faulty wire in the base. Carefully, you disconnect it. The hum stops. You take the fragment again, and this time, no alarm sounds. The prize is yours, silently.
[[Leave the vault->Skybreaker-Vault-Escape]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-Safe
You take the data-crystal. The core hums steadily behind you. You have the fragment, and you have saved the facility. Dr. Vale will be relieved. Now to get out before the Legion returns in force.
[[Return to the control room->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet]]
[[Find an escape route->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-ChoirInitiated
You enter the GeoCore vault. The power here is an affront to the Grey Mother. Your mission is sabotage. You bypass the controls, overloading the cooling systems. Alarms blare as the core begins to heat uncontrollably. The Legion's prize will become their pyre.
[[Flee the impending explosion->Skybreaker-Vault-Escape-ChoirInitiated]]
::Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Secured
With the control room secure, you and Dr. Vale make your way to the GeoCore vault. The hallways are quiet, the Legion having retreated. The vault door is still ajar. The fragment awaits inside, untouched by the chaos.
[[Enter the vault->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-Secured]]

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-FragmentTaken-WithLyra
You grab the crystalline tablet from the dais. The trap is disabled. Lyra grins. "Two fragments down. The next one is at the Skybreaker, if the rumors are true." You both hurry from the atrium before any guardians arrive.
[[Exit the library->SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithLyra-Fragment]]

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-GuardianFight
A stone guardian enters the atrium, its eyes fixed on you trapped in the field. It raises a massive fist to smash the barrier. Lyra shouts a warning. You brace for impact, weapon ready. There is no escape, only fight.
[[Stand and fight->SunkenLibrary-Captured]]
::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-UrgeEscape
"Go, Lyra! Save yourself!" you yell. Lyra hesitates, then nods grimly. "I'll find help!" She turns and runs as the guardian approaches. You are left alone, a prisoner in a field of light, facing the judgment of the stone sentinel.
[[Face the guardian->SunkenLibrary-Captured]]
::SunkenLibrary-Captured-Defiant
"You cling to the ashes of a dead world," you snarl. "Haven-0 is hope, not heresy." The acolyte's face hardens. "Hope is the greatest heresy of all. You will be cleansed, slowly." The cell door locks shut forever.
[[Await your fate->Ending-ChoirPrisoner]]
::SunkenLibrary-Captured-Plea
"I seek only to heal the world," you explain. The acolyte considers your words. "Healing is a rejection of the Mother's will. But your intent is... pure, if misguided. You will be exiled, never to return to this sacred place." They lead you to a tunnel out of the mountains.
[[Accept exile->MountainPass-Ascent]]
::SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithLyra-Fragment
You and Lyra exit the Sunken Library as the dawn breaks. The second fragment is secure. Lyra plots a course to the Skybreaker ruins. "The Legion is there, but so is the next piece. We need to move quickly."
[[Travel to the Skybreaker->Skybreaker-Approach-WithLyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithMoth-Fragment
You and Moth leave the library with the second fragment. The Nomad sand-ship is waiting. "The Skybreaker is our next goal," Moth says. "The elder spoke of a great conflict there. We must be careful."
[[Set sail for the Skybreaker->Skybreaker-Approach-WithMoth]]

::SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithMoth-Slate
You exit the library with the crucial data-slate but not the second fragment. Moth looks concerned. "We have the location, but we need all the fragments to open Haven-0. We must find the others first."
[[Head for the Skybreaker ruins->Skybreaker-Approach-WithMoth]]

::SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth-Fragment
You and Moth leave the archive chamber, the second fragment safely in your possession. The library's halls are silent, the test passed. You have proven your worth. The path ahead leads to the final fragments.
[[Exit the library->SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithMoth-Fragment]]
::Skybreaker-Approach-WithLyra
The Skybreaker ruins loom ahead, a jagged scar on the mountain's face. Lyra points her scanner at the main entrance. "Legion patrols, but their pattern is sloppy. They're focused inside. The GeoCore vault is our target. I can get us in through a maintenance shaft I detected." She leads you to a concealed hatch partially buried in scree.
[[Enter the maintenance shaft->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithLyra]]

::Skybreaker-Approach-WithMoth
The Nomad sand-ship anchors at a safe distance from the Skybreaker. Moth studies the Legion activity through a scope. "They've secured the perimeter. But I know a way—an old ventilation tunnel from the northern ridge. It's a tight fit, but it should bring us out near the central halls." She slings her pack over her shoulder.
[[Climb to the ventilation tunnel->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithMoth]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Escape-ChoirInitiated
You run as the GeoCore chamber groans behind you, the overload reaching critical mass. The Choir's mission is complete. A thunderous explosion rips through the facility, a pyre for the Legion's ambition. You emerge into the ash-filled daylight, the ruins collapsing into a fiery grave. The Grey Mother is appeased.
[[Return to the Choir->Ending-ChoirVictory]]
::Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-Secured
The GeoCore vault is quiet, the hum of the stabilized core a steady backdrop. Dr. Vale points to the pedestal. "There it is. The third fragment. With this, we have the complete set." The data-crystal glows invitingly, the key to Haven-0 within reach.
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-Safe]]
::Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithLyra
The maintenance shaft is tight, but Lyra's light guides the way. You emerge into a quiet service corridor deep within the ruins. The sound of distant gunfire echoes. "The vault is this way," Lyra whispers, consulting her scanner. "But the Legion is between us and it. We need a distraction."
[[Create a diversion by overloading a junction box->Skybreaker-Corridor-Diversion-WithLyra-Escape]]
[[Sneak past the patrol using stealth->Skybreaker-Corridor-Stealth-WithLyra-Escape]]
::Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithMoth
The ventilation tunnel is cramped and dusty. You and Moth drop into a dark storage room. Moth listens at the door. "Legion voices. They're searching the area. The central hall is just beyond. We can slip through while they're distracted."
[[Wait for the patrol to pass->Skybreaker-Storage-Wait-WithMoth]]

::Skybreaker-Storage-Wait-WithMoth
You and Moth press against crates in the dark storage room. The Legion patrol outside argues about a missing tool, then their footsteps recede. Moth peeks out. "Clear. The central hall is empty now. We can make it." She gestures forward.
[[Enter the central hall->Skybreaker-Hall-WithMoth]]

::Skybreaker-Hall-Dash-WithMoth
Moth takes a deep breath. "Ready? Go!" You both sprint from the storage room into the vast central hall. A Legion sentry shouts in surprise, but you're already across, diving behind a shattered console before he can raise his rifle. The vault corridor is just ahead.
[[Continue toward the vault->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithMoth]]
::Skybreaker-Hall-WithMoth
The central hall is a cavernous space dominated by a massive, shattered viewscreen. Dr. Oren Vale is pinned behind a console by Legion fire. He sees you and Moth and waves frantically. "The failsafe! They've armed it! Help me!" Captain Hale's voice booms from a upper walkway. "Kill the old man! The fragment is ours!"
[[Create a diversion to save Vale->Skybreaker-Hall-Diversion-WithMoth]]

:: Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithMoth
[[Take the main entrance->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithMoth-Alt]]
::Skybreaker-Hall-Diversion-WithMoth
You grab a canister from a broken console and hurl it across the hall. It clatters loudly, drawing the Legion's fire. Vale uses the distraction to scramble toward you and Moth. "The vault! The fragment is still inside! Hale doesn't have it yet!" You provide covering fire as the three of you retreat toward the vault corridor.
[[Retreat to the vault corridor->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithMoth]]

:: Skybreaker-Vault-BackupEntry-WithLyra
[[Observe the vault interior->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithLyra]]
::Skybreaker-Vault-BackupEntry-WithMoth
Moth leads you down the side passage to a small access panel. "Nomad maps showed this." She opens it, revealing a tight crawlspace. You wiggle through, emerging inside the GeoCore vault from a hidden niche. The main chamber is just ahead, the fragment glowing on its pedestal.
[[Approach the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithMoth]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithLyra
You are inside the humming GeoCore vault. The data-crystal fragment rests on the central pedestal. Lyra scans the area. "The core is stable. No immediate threats. But we must be quick." The two guards remain outside the main door, unaware of your presence.
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithLyra-Escape]]
[[Check the core controls first->Skybreaker-Vault-CoreControls-WithLyra-Escape]]
::Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithMoth
The GeoCore chamber is immense. Moth gasps at the glowing energy canisters. "The power here..." The third map fragment sits on the pedestal, unprotected. Dr. Vale's warning about the Legion and the failsafe echoes in your mind. You need to act fast.

::Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithMoth
You take the third fragment. Moth watches the doorway. "We have it! But the Legion is still in the halls." The fragment glows warmly in your hand, the map nearly complete. The core continues its steady hum behind you.
[[Retreat to the central hall->Skybreaker-Hall-WithMoth-Fragment]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Stabilize-WithMoth
Moth helps you adjust the cooling systems, following instructions from a nearby manual. The core's erratic humming smooths out. "Stable," Moth says with relief. "Now we can take the fragment without causing a meltdown."
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithMoth]]
::Skybreaker-Hall-WithMoth-Fragment
You and Moth retreat from the vault, the third fragment secure. Dr. Vale follows, clutching a data-slate. "The Legion controls the main exit. But there's an old escape tunnel from the control room, if we can reach it." Shouts echo from the central hall as Legion soldiers organize a search.
[[Head for the control room->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet-WithMoth]]
[[Try the ventilation tunnel you entered by->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithMoth]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Escape-WithLyra
With the fragment in hand, you and Lyra slip out the way you came. The backup tunnel leads you safely away from the vault. You emerge into a quiet service corridor far from the Legion's main force. The path to the surface is clear.
[[Escape the ruins->Skybreaker-Escape-WithLyra]]
::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet-WithMoth
You, Moth, and Dr. Vale burst into the control room. Vale immediately starts typing at the console. "The Legion has overridden the primary systems! The failsafe is counting down!" The screen shows a ten-minute countdown. "I can stop it, but I need you to guard the door. They'll be here any second." Moth readies her weapon, watching the corridor.
[[Guard the door while Vale works->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Hold-WithMoth-Vale]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Hold-WithMoth-Vale
You stand with Moth at the doorway, weapons ready. Legion soldiers appear at the end of the hall and charge. You and Moth lay down suppressing fire, forcing them to take cover. Behind you, Vale works frantically. "Almost... there!" he shouts. The countdown stops. "The tunnel is open! Let's go!"
[[Retreat into the escape tunnel->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Escape-WithMoth-Vale]]
::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Escape-WithMoth-Vale
Vale pulls open a hidden panel, revealing a dark, dusty tunnel. "This leads to the surface, north of the ruins," he says. Moth covers the entrance as you slip inside. The tunnel slopes upward, away from the Legion's grasp. You have the third fragment, and Dr. Vale is safe. The final journey to Haven-0 awaits.
[[Emerge into the highlands->HighlandsTrail-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
::HighlandsTrail-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
You emerge from the escape tunnel into the crisp highland air. Dr. Vale breathes deeply, his first taste of freedom in years. Moth points to the horizon. "Haven-0 lies beyond the Forbidden Zone. It's a treacherous crossing, but with the fragments and the doctor, we have a chance." Vale adjusts his glasses, studying the combined map. "The final fragment is said to be at the GeoCore's primary vault, but our path is clear. We must move quickly before the Legion rallies."
[[Travel toward the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZone-Approach-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
::ForbiddenZone-Approach-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
The Forbidden Zone is a landscape of jagged, blackened rock and rivers of slow-flowing ash. Strange lights flicker in the perpetual gloom. Vale consults the map. "The old seismic readings show instabilities. We must tread carefully." Moth scouts ahead, finding a path marked by ancient, weathered stones. "This is the Pilgrim's Way. It should be safe, if the stories are true."
[[Follow the Pilgrim's Way->ForbiddenZone-PilgrimWay-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
[[Take a riskier shortcut->ForbiddenZone-Shortcut-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
::ForbiddenZone-PilgrimWay-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
The Pilgrim's Way is a narrow path of solid ground winding through the ash rivers. Moth leads, her steps sure. Vale points to strange rock formations. "Energy signatures. Residual from the Cataclysm." A low chanting echoes from a canyon to the left—the Ashen Choir. They haven't seen you. The path continues straight, safe but long.
[[Continue on the path->ForbiddenZone-PilgrimWay2-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
[[Investigate the chanting->ForbiddenZone-ChoirEncounter-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]

::ForbiddenZone-Shortcut-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
You leave the marked path, cutting across a field of unstable ash. The ground shifts underfoot. Vale's scanner beeps warnings. "The crust is thin here!" A sudden collapse opens a sinkhole ahead, revealing a buried pre-Cataclysm transit tunnel. It's dark, but it heads in the right direction.
[[Enter the tunnel->ForbiddenZone-Tunnel-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
[[Backtrack to the Pilgrim's Way->ForbiddenZone-PilgrimWay-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
::ForbiddenZone-ChoirEncounter-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
The chanting grows louder as you peer into the canyon. A group of Ashen Choir acolytes circle a monolith of black rock. They are anointing it with ash. One turns and spots you. "Interlopers! You tread on sacred ground!" They begin to advance, their eyes glowing with fervor. Vale shrinks back. "Their faith is a weapon here. We must not fight them."
[[Retreat to the Pilgrim's Way->ForbiddenZone-PilgrimWay2-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
[[Try to reason with them->ForbiddenZone-ChoirDialogue-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]

::ForbiddenZone-PilgrimWay2-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
The Pilgrim's Way continues, winding safely away from the Choir canyon. The air grows still and heavy. Moth points to a distant structure—a towering arcology of white alloy, shimmering through the ash haze. Haven-0. The final approach is before you. Vale checks the fragments. "They are resonating. The door will open for us."
[[Approach Haven-0->Haven0-Approach-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]

::ForbiddenZone-Tunnel-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
You drop into the dark transit tunnel. Moth lights a glow-stick. The tunnel is intact, an old mag-lev line. You follow it for miles, emerging into a vast cavern. A subterranean river of clean water flows here, and the air is pure. On the far side, a ramp leads upward, directly to the base of the Haven-0 structure. You have found a back door.
[[Ascend the ramp->Haven0-Approach-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
::ForbiddenZone-ChoirDialogue-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
The lead acolyte steps forward, his face painted with ash symbols. "This land is consecrated to the Grey Mother. Your machine hope is a blight upon her face." Moth keeps her hands visible. "We mean no disrespect. We only seek passage." The acolyte studies Dr. Vale, who clutches the map fragments. "The old-world ghost. You would resurrect the poison that killed the world. The Mother demands your departure, or your dissolution."
[[Offer them a fragment as a toll->ForbiddenZone-ChoirBribe-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
[[Stand your ground and argue for Haven-0->ForbiddenZone-ChoirArgument-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]

::Haven0-Approach-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
The great white arcology of Haven-0 rises before you, untouched by time or ash. The air is clean and still. A massive entrance door, seamless and imposing, blocks the way. Dr. Vale approaches a terminal beside it. "The fragments. This is the moment." He inserts the combined map into a slot. The terminal glows, and the door begins to retract with a deep hum, revealing a pristine interior. The final choice awaits.
[[Enter Haven-0->Haven0-Interior-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]
::ForbiddenZone-ChoirArgument-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
You step forward, meeting the acolyte's gaze. "Haven-0 is not a blight. It is a chance to heal the world your Grey Mother shrouded in ash. To give life back to the wastes." The acolyte's eyes narrow. "Healing is arrogance. The Mother's will is final." He raises a hand, and the other acolytes begin a low, resonant chant. The very air thickens, pushing you back. Vale staggers. "Their faith creates a psycho-acoustic field! We cannot pass!" The path ahead is blocked by an invisible wall of fervent belief.
[[Retreat and find another way->ForbiddenZone-PilgrimWay2-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]

::ForbiddenZone-ChoirBribe-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
You hold out one of the map fragments. "Take this. It is a piece of the old world. A relic for your Mother. Let us pass." The lead acolyte considers the glowing crystal. He takes it, his fingers tracing its surface. "A worthy offering. The Mother accepts your tribute." He steps aside, and the chanting ceases. The path is clear. You continue, but the loss of a fragment is a heavy price. Vale looks worried. "The door may not open without a complete set."
[[Continue toward Haven-0->Haven0-Approach-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment]]

::Haven0-Interior-WithMoth-Vale-Fragment
You step into a vast, silent hall of gleaming white alloy. The air is sterile. A central dais holds a complex console with a single, illuminated slot. Dr. Vale approaches it reverently. "The atmospheric purifier. With the fragments, we can activate it." He looks at you and Moth. "But the controls offer more than purification. They can be calibrated for dominion, or... for termination. The choice is yours." The weight of the world rests on your next decision.
[[Activate the purifier for restoration->Ending-Restoration]]

[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithLyra-Escape]]
[[Check the core controls first->Skybreaker-Vault-CoreControls-WithLyra-Escape]]

You and Lyra find an emergency exit and push through into the highlands. The Skybreaker ruins recede behind you. The third fragment is secure. Lyra checks the combined map. "Haven-0 is the final goal. We must move quickly."
[[Travel to the Forbidden Zone->ForbiddenZone-Approach-WithLyra]]

::Skybreaker-Corridor-Diversion-WithLyra-Escape
Lyra points to a wall-mounted junction box. "Overloading this will cause a power surge, drawing their attention." She reroutes her bracelet's energy into the box. Sparks fly, and lights flicker down the hall. Shouts echo as Legion soldiers rush toward the disturbance. "Now! While they're distracted!" She dashes toward the vault corridor.
[[Head for the vault->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithLyra-Escape]]

::Skybreaker-Corridor-Stealth-WithLyra-Escape
You signal for silence and hug the shadowy wall. A Legion patrol marches past, arguing about the facility's instability. You and Lyra slip into an alcove until their footsteps fade. The path to the GeoCore vault is clear for a moment.
[[Move quickly to the vault->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithLyra-Escape]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-BackupEntry-WithLyra-Escape
Lyra points to a ventilation grate. "This should connect to the backup tunnel." You pry it open and crawl inside. The tunnel is cramped but leads directly into the GeoCore vault. You drop down silently behind a bank of machinery, unnoticed by the two guards at the main entrance.
[[Observe the vault interior->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithLyra-Escape]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-CoreControls-WithLyra-Escape
Lyra studies the core diagnostics. "The Legion's fighting has caused fluctuations. It's holding, but a surge could destabilize it." She reroutes a power conduit. "There. It's safer now. The fragment is ready." The core's hum becomes a steady, quiet thrum.
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithLyra-Escape]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithLyra-Escape
You lift the data-crystal from the pedestal. It connects with a soft chime to the fragments you already carry. Lyra smiles. "Three. Just one more. We need to get to Haven-0 before the Legion regroups." The vault remains stable, your prize secured.
[[Escape the vault->Skybreaker-Vault-Escape-WithLyra]]

::ForbiddenZone-Approach-WithLyra
The Forbidden Zone is a landscape of jagged, blackened rock and rivers of slow-flowing ash. Strange lights flicker in the perpetual gloom. Lyra consults her scanner. "The path is unstable, but I detect a safe route." She leads you forward, the goal of Haven-0 clear ahead.
[[Follow Lyra's path->Haven0-Approach-WithLyra]]

::Haven0-Approach-WithLyra

::Ending-ChoirVictory
You report to the Choir sentinel. "The Skybreaker is destroyed. The Legion's ambition is ash." The sentinel places a hand on your shoulder. "The Grey Mother is pleased. You have ensured the world remains in its proper state, shrouded and pure. You are a true child of ash." You join the chanting circle, your purpose fulfilled. The heresy of hope is extinguished.


::Ending-ChoirPrisoner
Days blend into weeks in the Choir's prison. The chanting is a constant dirge. Your resolve crumbles, replaced by the cold certainty of the ash. You become a silent acolyte, tending the sacred pits, your dream of Haven-0 forgotten. The Grey Mother's will is all.

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Exit-WithMoth
You and Moth leave the Sunken Library with the second fragment. The Nomad sand-ship is waiting. "The Skybreaker is our next goal," Moth says. "The elder spoke of a great conflict there. We must be careful."
[[Set sail for the Skybreaker->Skybreaker-Approach-WithMoth]]

You approach the Skybreaker ruins under the cover of the ongoing battle. Legion troops are engaged with automated turrets inside the entrance. You slip through a shattered side window unnoticed.
[[Enter the ruins->Skybreaker-Interior-Chaos-Alone]]
:: SunkenLibrary-Archive-Chamber-Sneak
The chamber glows with a soft blue light. In its center, a pedestal holds not a fragment, but an ancient data-slate. It displays a star chart, one point pulsating—the location of Haven-0. This is a crucial piece of the puzzle.
[[Take the data-slate->SunkenLibrary-Archive-SlateTaken-Sneak]]
[[Study the chart further->SunkenLibrary-Archive-Study-Sneak]]

:: SunkenLibrary-Archive-SlateTaken-Sneak
You take the data-slate. The pulsating point on the star chart is a clear coordinate—the final key to locating Haven-0. This is not a fragment, but a guide. With this and your fragments, the path is clear.
[[Continue your search for the second fragment->SunkenLibrary-Archive-Search]]
[[Leave the library with the slate->SunkenLibrary-Exit-Sneak-Slate]]

:: SunkenLibrary-Archive-Study-Sneak
You study the star chart. The pulsating point is labeled "Haven-0 Prime." Other points are marked "GeoCore" and "Skybreaker." The chart shows that the facility requires a massive power source to activate. The Skybreaker ruins make sense now.
[[Memorize the chart and leave the slate->SunkenLibrary-Archive-Search]]

::HighlandsTrail-Alone
You climb into the highlands, the wind biting through your clothes. The path is lonely. A cave offers shelter from the worsening ash-laden wind. Inside, you find remnants of an old camp—a dry blanket and some tinder. The way forward splits: one path leads toward the Union outpost, the other toward the Sunken Library.

::Skybreaker-Approach-Alone
The Skybreaker ruins loom ahead, a jagged scar on the mountain. Legion activity is visible at the main entrance. A patrol moves along the perimeter. A service hatch on the north side appears unguarded for the moment. The GeoCore vault is your target.
[[Sneak in through the service hatch->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak]]
[[Wait and watch for an opening->Skybreaker-Approach-Wait]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-Alone
The great gate of the Sunken Library is sealed, covered in intricate carvings. No token or guide is here to help you. You search the perimeter and find a hidden crevice behind a fallen pillar. It leads to a narrow tunnel that snakes into the library's foundation.
[[Crawl through the tunnel->SunkenLibrary-Interior-Sneak]]

You show the sentinel your singed map fragment. He leans close, his eyes widening. "The Haven-Seeker's mark. The elder has spoken of this. You are expected." He lowers his spear and gestures toward the sand-ships. "Rest with us. The journey to the Library is perilous."
[[Enter the camp->NomadCamp-Alone-Map]]
:: NomadRendezvous-Approach-Traveler
"I am a traveler, lost in the ash," you say, keeping your hands visible. The sentinel studies you, then points to a small fire away from the main ships. "You may rest there for one night. Share no lies with the tribe." His tone makes it clear this is a limited hospitality.
[[Rest by the fire->NomadRendezvous-Exile-Alone]]
::NomadRendezvous-Exile-Plea
"I seek sanctuary," you say, your voice raw. "The Legion cast me out. I mean no harm." The sentinels confer in low tones. One steps forward. "Mercy is rare in the wastes. You may tend the glow-moss for one night. Then you must leave."
[[Accept the harsh terms->NomadRendezvous-Exile]]

::NomadRendezvous-Exile-Flee
You turn and scramble back down the slope, ignoring the shouts behind you. A spear whips past your shoulder, embedding in the ash. You run until your lungs burn, the Nomad plateau a dark line on the horizon. Alone again, with only the harsh wind for company.
[[Head east toward the mountains->BlastedFlats-ExileFollow]]

::SunkenLibrary-Approach-WithMoth-Lyra
The Sunken Library rises from the valley floor, a majestic structure half-consumed by crystalline ash. Lyra checks her scanner. "The signal is strong inside. But there are energy signatures—guardians." Moth points to a hidden path. "The Nomads showed me a side entrance."
[[Approach the main entrance->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Use the Nomad side path->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Side-WithMoth-Lyra]]
:: NomadRendezvous-Exile-Alone
You are given a spot by a small fire, away from the main Nomad camp. The sentinels watch you warily. You get a few hours of restless sleep before being roused at dawn. "Your time is up. Leave now." You are sent back into the wastes, alone.
[[Head east toward the mountains->BlastedFlats-ExileFollow]]

:: NomadCamp-Alone-Map
The Nomad camp is a vibrant collection of tents and sand-ships. The elder examines your map fragment. "The Sunken Library holds the next piece. But you travel alone? That is dangerous. Rest tonight. At dawn, a ship leaves for the Glass Wastes. You may board it."
[[Rest for the journey->NomadCamp-Alone-Rest]]
[[Ask about the library guardians->NomadCamp-Alone-Guardians]]

:: Skybreaker-Interior-Chaos-Alone
Inside, the ruins are a maze of shattered machinery and flickering lights. Legion soldiers exchange fire with unseen defenders deep within. The chaos provides cover. A sign points to "GeoCore Vault" down a side corridor.
[[Head for the GeoCore Vault->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Alone]]
[[Search for the central control room->Skybreaker-ControlRoomApproach-Alone]]

:: MercyEnd-WellHide-Escape-Alone
You and Lyra climb out of the cistern. She nods farewell. "Good luck. The Legion is everywhere." She disappears into the alleys. You are left alone to face the settlement.
[[Head for the market->MercyEnd-Market]]
[[Try to leave Mercy's End->MercyEnd-GateExit]]

::HighlandsTrail-Alone-Deserter
You climb into the highlands, the discarded Legion gear a heavy memory. Every shadow could be a patrol hunting deserters. You find a narrow gully to hide in, the wind howling a lonely tune. The path forks: one leads toward the Union outpost, the other toward the distant spires of the Sunken Library.
[[Head for the Union outpost->UnionOutpost-Gate-Scholar]]
[[Take the path toward the library->HighlandsTrail-LibraryDetour-Alone]]

::NomadCamp-Alone-Guardians
The elder nods solemnly. "The Silent Order are not human. They are automata from the old world, guardians of knowledge. They test seekers with visions of their deepest fears. Traveling alone, your test will be harder. Your own heart will be your only shield."
[[Accept the risk->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Alone]]

::NomadCamp-Alone-Rest
You rest in a spare tent, the sounds of the Nomad camp a gentle hum. At dawn, the sand-ship crew rouses you. The ship's sails catch the ash-laden wind, and you glide toward the Glass Wastes, the library your destination.
[[Board the sand-ship->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Alone]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoomApproach-Alone
You follow signs to the central control room, moving silently through the chaos. The hallway is littered with debris. The room ahead has a large viewscreen. An old man in a tattered lab coat is frantically typing at a console, unaware of your presence.
[[Approach the old man->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet]]

::Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Alone
The corridor to the GeoCore vault is dark, the sounds of battle echoing from other sectors. Two Legion guards stand watch at the vault door. They are focused outward, not expecting a lone intruder from the shadows.
[[Create a distraction to draw them away->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Distraction-Alone]]
[[Sneak past using the ceiling conduits->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Stealth-Alone]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-Side-WithMoth-Lyra
Moth leads you and Lyra to a crevice hidden behind a curtain of crystalline vines. "The Nomads use this entrance. It bypasses the main gate's guardians." You squeeze through into a dark, dusty tunnel that slopes downward into the library's depths.
[[Follow the tunnel->SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth-Lyra
The great gate is formidable. Lyra scans it while Moth keeps watch. "The lock is ancient," Lyra says. "I can bypass it, but it will take time. Moth, watch for guardians." Lyra works on a panel beside the gate, her tools sparking.
[[Stand guard with Moth->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Guard-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Help Lyra with the mechanism->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Help-WithMoth-Lyra]]
::Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Distraction-Alone
You find a loose pipe and hurl it down a side corridor. It clangs loudly against the metal floor. The two guards at the vault door start, then move cautiously to investigate the noise. The path to the vault is clear for a moment.
[[Rush the vault door->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-Alone]]

::Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Stealth-Alone
You climb onto a network of ceiling conduits, moving silently above the guards' heads. They continue their quiet conversation, unaware. You drop down behind them, just outside the vault entrance.
[[Open the vault door->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-Alone]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-Guard-WithMoth-Lyra
You and Moth keep watch while Lyra works on the gate mechanism. The badlands are eerily quiet. After a tense wait, Lyra smiles. "It's open." The massive gate groans inward, revealing the dark library within.
[[Enter the library->SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Gate-Help-WithMoth-Lyra
You assist Lyra, holding tools and stabilizing wires while she reroutes the ancient power coupling. Moth watches the perimeter. Together, you manage to bypass the lock. The gate swings open with a deep rumble.
[[Step inside->SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth-Lyra
The grand hall of the library is immense and silent. Lyra's scanner chirps. "The signal is coming from that direction." She points to a vast atrium ahead. Moth shivers. "The guardians are here. I can feel them." A soft glow emanates from the center of the atrium.
[[Approach the glow->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-WithMoth-Lyra]]
::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-WithMoth-Lyra
The atrium opens into a vast chamber, its ceiling lost in darkness. In the center, on a stone dais, rests a crystalline tablet—the second map fragment. It pulses with a soft light. Lyra scans the area. "The energy field is inactive. It's clear." Moth looks around nervously. "It feels too easy." The path to the dais is open.
[[Take the fragment->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-FragmentTaken-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Let Lyra take it->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-LyraTakesFragment]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-Alone
The GeoCore vault hums with latent power. The third map fragment glows on its central pedestal. The chamber is empty, the Legion guards still distracted. This is your chance. The core controls flicker, showing a stable but delicate reading.
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-Alone]]
[[Check the core stability first->Skybreaker-Vault-CoreCheck-Alone]]
::Skybreaker-Vault-CoreCheck-Alone
You examine the core controls. The diagnostics show the core is stable, but brittle. The Legion's assault has stressed the containment fields. A single shock could trigger a cascade failure. The fragment sits on the pedestal, a tantalizing prize. Taking it might destabilize everything.
[[Take the fragment anyway->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-Alone]]
[[Stabilize the core first->Skybreaker-Vault-Stabilize-Alone]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-Alone
You grasp the data-crystal. The moment it leaves the pedestal, a deep hum surges through the vault. Red lights flash. A robotic voice announces, "Unauthorized removal. Containment breach imminent." The core begins to pulse erratically. You must flee.
[[Escape the vault->Skybreaker-Vault-Escape-Alone]]

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-FragmentTaken-WithMoth-Lyra
You take the crystalline tablet from the dais. It connects with a soft chime to your first fragment. Lyra nods approvingly. "Two fragments. The path to the Skybreaker is next." Moth breathes a sigh of relief. "No guardians. We were lucky." You hurry from the atrium before your luck runs out.
[[Exit the library->SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithMoth-Lyra-Fragment]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Escape-Alone
You sprint from the vault as alarms scream. The hallway shakes violently. Behind you, the GeoCore containment fails in a flash of blinding light. The shockwave throws you forward into the main corridor. You have the fragment, but the Skybreaker is dying around you, molten rock dripping from the ceiling.
[[Race for the exit->Ending-SkybreakerEscape]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Stabilize-Alone
You work frantically at the core controls, rerouting auxiliary power to reinforce the containment field. The erratic hum steadies. The warning lights fade to a cautious yellow. The core is stable, for now. The fragment is safe to take.
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-Alone]]

::SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithMoth-Lyra-Fragment
You, Moth, and Lyra exit the Sunken Library as the dawn breaks. The second fragment is secure. Lyra checks her scanner. "The signal leads to the Skybreaker ruins. The Legion is there, but so is the next piece." Moth points toward the mountains. "The Nomads can get us close. We need to move quickly."
[[Travel to the Skybreaker->Skybreaker-Approach-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::HighlandsTrail-LibraryDetour-WithLyra
Lyra leads the way, her scanner guiding you through the highlands. You turn toward the Sunken Library, descending into a valley of crystalline ash. The library's spires loom ahead.
[[Approach the library entrance->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithLyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithLyra-Fragment-LyraTakes
You and Lyra exit the Sunken Library at dawn. Lyra secures the fragment in her case. "My tech will mask its signature. The Skybreaker is our next target. We must move before the Legion consolidates." She leads the way toward the mountains.
[[Travel to the Skybreaker->Skybreaker-Approach-WithLyra]]

::NomadRendezvous-WithMoth-Token-Scout
You return to the rendezvous with the extra rations and filtered mask from your scouting. Moth nods in approval. "This will help." The sentinel gestures you toward the waiting sand-ship. "Dawn departure. Rest now."
[[Board the sand-ship->NomadCamp-WithMoth-Gear]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithLyra-Approach
You and Lyra enter the GeoCore vault after stunning the guards. The chamber hums with power, the fragment glowing on its pedestal. Lyra keeps watch at the door. "Hurry. They won't be out long."
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithLyra-Escape]]
[[Check the core controls->Skybreaker-Vault-CoreControls-WithLyra-Escape]]

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Exit-WithMoth-MothTakes
Moth carries the fragment carefully as you exit the library. "I'll keep it safe," she says. The Nomad ship awaits. "To the Skybreaker. We must hurry—the Legion is already there."
[[Set sail for the Skybreaker->Skybreaker-Approach-WithMoth]]

::BadlandsTrail-WithMoth-Lyra
You, Moth, and Lyra move quickly through the badlands, putting distance between yourselves and Mercy's End. Lyra checks her scanner. "The Legion will be hunting us. Our best hope is the Sunken Library. I've deciphered part of the signal—the second fragment is there." Moth points northeast. "The Nomads know a safe route. We should head for their rendezvous point."
[[Travel to the Nomad rendezvous->NomadRendezvous-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Follow Lyra's signal directly->SunkenLibrary-Approach-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::MercyEnd-LyraEscape-WithMoth
Lyra grabs her pack. "The Legion is blocking the main gates. I know a way out through the old drainage system." She leads you and Moth to a grate behind a stack of crates. "It's tight, but it comes out beyond the walls." The sounds of searching soldiers grow closer.
[[Enter the drainage tunnel->MercyEnd-VentEscape-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::Skybreaker-Approach-WithMoth-Lyra
The Skybreaker ruins dominate the horizon. Moth scouts ahead with a scope. "Legion patrols are heavy at the main entrance." Lyra points her scanner at the northern face. "I'm reading a weak spot in their sensor coverage. There's a collapsed section we can climb through."
[[Climb through the collapse->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Create a diversion to draw the patrols away->Skybreaker-Approach-Diversion-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithLyra
The corridor to the GeoCore vault is clear for the moment. Lyra checks a wall terminal. "The vault door is sealed, but the security log shows a maintenance override active. I can trigger it." She reroutes power, and the heavy door grinds open.
[[Enter the vault->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithLyra]]

::Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithLyra-Escape
You and Lyra dash down the corridor toward the vault. A Legion patrol spots you and opens fire. Lyra creates a smokescreen with her bracelet. "The door is just ahead! I'll hold them off while you get it open!"
[[Reach the vault door->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithLyra-Escape]]

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-LyraTakesFragment
Lyra steps forward and carefully lifts the crystalline tablet from the dais. "My tech can analyze this safely." The fragment glows in her hands, connecting to your first piece. "The encryption is complex, but I can break it. We have the second key."
[[Exit the library with the fragment->SunkenLibrary-Exit-WithLyra-Fragment-LyraTakes]]

::SunkenLibrary-Atrium-MothTakesFragment
Moth approaches the dais reverently. "The elders spoke of this." She takes the fragment, holding it with care. "It feels... alive. The path is clearer now. The Skybreaker awaits."
[[Leave the library->SunkenLibrary-Atrium-Exit-WithMoth-MothTakes]]
::NomadRendezvous-WithMoth-Lyra
You arrive at the Nomad rendezvous with Lyra. The sentinels eye the technomancer warily, but Moth vouches for her. "She's with us. She can help decipher the map." The elder's token grants you passage. One sentinel warns, "The path to the Library is watched by the Choir. Travel at dawn." Lyra studies the horizon. "Their energy signatures are faint. We can avoid them."
[[Rest at the camp->NomadCamp-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Depart immediately under cover of night->SunkenLibrary-Approach-WithMoth-Lyra-Night]]

::Skybreaker-Approach-Diversion-WithMoth-Lyra
Lyra points to a Legion communications relay on a nearby ridge. "If I overload that, it will cause a system-wide alert, drawing their forces away from the entrance." Moth nods. "I can create a dust cloud with this flare to mask our approach." You coordinate the plan.
[[Execute the diversion->Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithMoth-Lyra-Diversion]]

::Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithMoth-Lyra
You climb through the collapsed section into a dark maintenance corridor. Lyra's light guides the way. Moth listens for patrols. "They're distracted by the alert outside," she whispers. The corridor leads downward, toward the heart of the facility. A sign points to the GeoCore vault.
[[Follow the signs to the vault->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Head toward the control room to find Dr. Vale->Skybreaker-ControlRoomApproach-WithMoth-Lyra]]
::NomadCamp-WithMoth-Lyra
The Nomad camp is alive with movement. Moth introduces you and Lyra to her tribe. The elders are wary of the technomancer, but Moth's word holds weight. Lyra keeps to herself, scanning the horizon. "The Choir's energy is distant. We can move at dawn." A sand-ship captain offers you a place on his vessel. "The Glass Wastes are treacherous at night. Rest now."
[[Board the sand-ship at dawn->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Ask Lyra about the map signal->NomadCamp-WithMoth-Lyra-Signal]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoomApproach-WithMoth-Lyra
You, Moth, and Lyra move through the ruined corridors toward the control room. Lyra's scanner picks up frantic life signs. "That must be Vale." You round a corner and see the control room door, partially open. Legion shouts echo from within. Vale is trapped behind a console, the failsafe countdown visible on a screen.
[[Charge in to save Vale->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Create a diversion from the hallway->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Diversion-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::Skybreaker-Interior-Sneak-WithMoth-Lyra-Diversion
Lyra's overload of the comm relay causes a satisfying spark and pop. Alarms blare across the Legion positions. Moth's flare creates a thick dust cloud, hiding your approach. You slip through the main entrance unnoticed in the chaos. The interior is in disarray, soldiers running in confusion. The path to the vault is clear.
[[Head for the GeoCore vault->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::Skybreaker-VaultApproach-WithMoth-Lyra
The corridor to the vault is quieter than expected, the diversion having drawn most guards away. Lyra checks a terminal. "The vault door is sealed, but I can bypass it." Moth keeps watch at the corridor's entrance. "Hurry, they'll regroup soon." Lyra's tools spark against the door's mechanism.
[[Enter the vault->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Help Moth set up a rear guard->Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Guard-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::SunkenLibrary-Approach-WithMoth-Lyra-Night
You, Moth, and Lyra leave the Nomad camp under the cover of darkness. The moon is hidden by ash, providing perfect concealment. Lyra uses a low-light scanner to guide you. "The Choir's patrols are minimal at night." You reach the library's outer wall without incident. A side entrance, known to Moth, stands before you.
[[Enter the library through the side entrance->SunkenLibrary-Interior-WithMoth-Lyra]]
::NomadCamp-WithMoth-Lyra-Signal
Lyra shows you her scanner. "The signal from the library is a cipher key. It overlays perfectly with the symbols on your fragment. The second piece is there, but it's protected by a resonance lock. My tech can disrupt it, but it will be loud. We'll have to be quick."
[[Prepare for a loud entry->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Ask if there's a quieter way->NomadCamp-WithMoth-Lyra-Quiet]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Diversion-WithMoth-Lyra
You and Moth create a racket in the hallway, knocking over loose panels and shouting. The Legion soldiers inside the control room turn toward the noise. Lyra uses the distraction to slip inside and pull Vale to safety behind a bank of servers. The soldiers rush out into the hall, looking for the source of the commotion.
[[Slip into the control room while they're distracted->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-ValeMet-WithMoth-Lyra
Dr. Vale looks up, startled, as you, Moth, and Lyra enter. "You're not Legion! Thank the stars! The failsafe is armed! They're trying to trigger a meltdown!" The countdown on the screen reads three minutes. Lyra immediately goes to a secondary console. "I can counter the override, but I need cover!"
[[Guard the door while Lyra works->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Hold-WithMoth-Lyra-Vale]]
[[Help Lyra at the console->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-HelpLyra-WithMoth-Vale]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithMoth-Lyra
The GeoCore vault is immense, humming with contained power. The third fragment glows on its central pedestal. Lyra scans the area. "The core is stable. The Legion's distraction worked—no guards inside." Moth watches the vault entrance. "We need to be fast. They'll be back."
[[Take the fragment->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Have Lyra disable any security first->Skybreaker-Vault-SecurityCheck-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::Skybreaker-VaultApproach-Guard-WithMoth-Lyra
You help Moth barricade the corridor entrance with fallen debris. "This will slow them down," she says. Lyra works faster on the vault door. "Almost... got it!" The door grinds open. "Inside, now!" You retreat into the vault as the first Legion soldiers round the corner and open fire on the barricade.
[[Enter the vault and seal the door->Skybreaker-Vault-Interior-WithMoth-Lyra]]
::NomadCamp-WithMoth-Lyra-Quiet
"There is a quieter way," Lyra admits. "The resonance lock can be disrupted with a precise frequency, but it requires getting very close to the fragment itself. We'd need to enter silently, avoid the main guardians, and reach the inner chamber. It's riskier for us, but quieter for the library."
[[Agree to the silent approach->SunkenLibrary-Gate-Side-WithMoth-Lyra]]
[[Stick with the faster, louder plan->SunkenLibrary-Gate-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-HelpLyra-WithMoth-Vale
You join Lyra at the console, following her rapid instructions. Moth guards the door, firing warning shots down the hall. "Reroute primary power to auxiliary conduit seven!" Lyra shouts. You find the command, typing frantically. The countdown wavers, pausing at fifteen seconds. "Now, initiate the bypass sequence!" The screen flashes green. The failsafe is disarmed.
[[Secure the escape route->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Escape-WithMoth-Lyra-Vale]]

::Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Hold-WithMoth-Lyra-Vale
You and Moth take positions at the doorway, laying down suppressive fire against the advancing Legion soldiers. They are forced to take cover. Behind you, Lyra and Vale work in a frenzy. "The override is almost neutralized!" Vale yells. The countdown stops. A hidden panel in the floor slides open. "The escape tunnel! Go!" Lyra urges.
[[Descend into the tunnel->Skybreaker-ControlRoom-Escape-WithMoth-Lyra-Vale]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithMoth-Lyra
You grasp the data-crystal. It connects with the others, a soft hum confirming the link. "We have it," you say. Lyra nods, already moving toward the door. "The Legion will be here any second. We need to move." Moth checks the corridor. "The barricade won't hold much longer!"
[[Retreat through the vault's backup tunnel->Skybreaker-Vault-Escape-WithMoth-Lyra]]

::Skybreaker-Vault-SecurityCheck-WithMoth-Lyra
Lyra scans the pedestal. "There's a weight sensor and an energy field. Taking the fragment will trigger a localized alarm and possibly a lockdown." She reroutes a power coupling from her bracelet. "I can create a feedback loop. It will fool the sensor for about thirty seconds after we take it. Be ready to run."
[[Take the fragment quickly->Skybreaker-Vault-FragmentTaken-WithMoth-Lyra]]
