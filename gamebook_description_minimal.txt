WORLD OVERVIEW
In 2149 the Ashfall Cataclysm destroyed civilization after a chain of super-eruptions triggered by failed geothermal experiments. Ash clouds darkened the skies and toxic storms shaped a new wasteland world. Survivors gather in scattered settlements, each with their own rules and fears. Rumors spread of Haven-0, an old-world facility capable of cleansing the atmosphere.

The Wanderer, a lone traveler of player-chosen origins, finds a burned map fragment believed to lead to Haven-0. Three more fragments exist somewhere in the wasteland.
